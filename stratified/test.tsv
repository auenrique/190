Honey , why don't you go out to the kitchen and bring us some of those ... fancy little hors d'oeuvres .	8	['8']	8
Could you show me where they are ?	8	['8']	8
Whatever I was , that was a long time ago .	6	['6']	6

Came out and took off . I stayed with him .	8, 5	['8', ' 5']	8
You disturb the neighbors , I'll cut you up and eat you for dinner .	3	['3']	3

There's nothing to be afraid of .	8	['8']	8
So many people are not interested in changing the laws in regards to the internet .	1, 6	['1', ' 6']	1
You mean to tell me you wear a different dress for different times of the day ?	7	['7']	7
Yeah . - More than anything else in the world ?	2, 5	['2', ' 5']	2
Well , I'd begun to feel that I didn't have any part in your life , that I was an outsider .	6	['6']	6

Maybe I'll run into you .	2	['2']	2
No , don't touch that !	4	['4']	4
Yeah , I think so .	2	['2']	2
The sword was her husband's .	8	['8']	8
It'll only get you in trouble .	4	['4']	4
I only have sex when I'm happy .	5	['5']	5
But I just laughed and begged them to keep on doing it !	5	['5']	5
Yeah , are you gonna feed her ?	1, 2	['1', ' 2']	1
Then understand your place in the palace , nowhere else !	3	['3']	3
Well , I no longer wish to buy your company and take it apart . I don't want anyone else to either .	1	['1']	1
I'm gonna do it now .	2	['2']	2
And I just disagreed with them , completely .	3	['3']	3
Captain , there ain't no man on earth I'd rather serve under .	8	['8']	8
Takes a stool to find a stool , huh , Lieutenant ?	3	['3']	3
She's an angel .	8, 5	['8', ' 5']	8
Don't look at me .	1, 4	['1', ' 4']	1
No , I would ... I would remember something like that .	6	['6']	6
Your whore .	1, 3	['1', ' 3']	1
Leon !	4, 6	['4', ' 6']	4
Why is he letting him go ?	7	['7']	7
Open that door again , you'll run a 3 - legged race to the undertaker .	3	['3']	3
Who gave you this idea ?	1	['1']	1
How come she leave that job ?	7	['7']	7
Let's get down to particulars .	2	['2']	2
It's good , isn't it ?	5	['5']	5
Hello . [PERSON] , is that you ?	2	['2']	2
Gentlemen , we'll get to the business of the evening .	2	['2']	2
Mr. [PERSON] was the first man ever to treat me decent .	8	['8']	8
You look tired , Little Big Man .	6	['6']	6
Just get out of here .	1	['1']	1
Is anyone down there ?	4	['4']	4
Just look at what they've done .	3	['3']	3
And you , all the time laughing at me .	1, 3	['1', ' 3']	1
Think he'll give me a raise ?	2	['2']	2
Nothing at [LOCATION] .	3	['3']	3
Hey , fuck you , man !	1	['1']	1
Can you share with me ?	8	['8']	8
I'm his prey .	4	['4']	4
What we have in mind has never been tried before .	2	['2']	2
He can't win in the House .	8	['8']	8
And in my first days , I will reach across party lines and devote my administration , your government , to securing them .	2	['2']	2
You must have some idea where he was going .	8	['8']	8
I'd sink this ship with all hands before I'd serve him .	3	['3']	3
Take your mind off my work .	3	['3']	3
This is your friendliest enemy reminding you to take it easy and never volunteer for anything .	5	['5']	5
Make yourself comfortable .	8	['8']	8
It's too late .	4	['4']	4
The court can't hear you .	4	['4']	4
[LOCATION]'s not that great , you know .	7	['7']	7
Hmm . - ( imitates monkey gibbering )	3	['3']	3
Who's our host ?	2	['2']	2
No one wants to fly with you .	1	['1']	1
I know you ... you murdering son of a bitch .	1, 3	['1', ' 3']	1
Oh , I just don't think I'm gonna have the time for it .	6	['6']	6
And don't forget , there are two things that have no limit :	2	['2']	2
The press release said that you were taking a leave to consider your career options .	2, 5	['2', ' 5']	2
Then we understand each other .	8	['8']	8
I suggest you keep that promise .	1, 2, 6	['1', ' 2', ' 6']	1
I'd love to .	2, 5	['2', ' 5']	2
[PERSON] , you look very handsome in a tuxedo .	5	['5']	5
Except you'll look better in 'em .	5	['5']	5
Keep the noise down , you stupid git !	1	['1']	1
I must break you .	1, 6	['1', ' 6']	1
You're annoying me .	1	['1']	1
That's what I do .	8, 5	['8', ' 5']	8
Civilians this time .	1, 3	['1', ' 3']	1
I'd give my soul to go , but I can't .	6	['6']	6
Quick , [PERSON] , we got ta extend the runway .	2	['2']	2
I will show you freaky ...	3	['3']	3
Cos whatever you got up there , I'm gonna find it out .	2, 3	['2', ' 3']	2
They liked each other immediately and got married ,	5	['5']	5
So what do you want to do ?	2	['2']	2
We can't keep riding with our stern to the wind .	6, 7	['6', ' 7']	6
I've got something to tell you .	8	['8']	8
The Belgian of the village ?	7	['7']	7
I thought you were getting fatter , Mama !	7	['7']	7
I thought I was the best stud - poker player in the world .	6	['6']	6
Sweetheart , the opinion of a madman doesn't impress me or anyone else .	3	['3']	3
Tonight we'll meet our contacts .	2	['2']	2
I think that we're lost .	4	['4']	4
The men aren't gonna be happy about what you've been doing .	1	['1']	1
Sometimes , as I'm falling asleep I can feel him breathing on my face and touching me with his hand .	6	['6']	6
He knows what [PERSON] said by heart and Boy Stuff is swell .	8	['8']	8
[PERSON] , I don't like to be here .	3	['3']	3
What if he kills [PERSON] ?	2, 4	['2', ' 4']	2
There ought to be some ...	7	['7']	7
[PERSON] , are you sure about that ?	8	['8']	8
Please ...	4	['4']	4
Yeah , no , no !	4	['4']	4
Go to hell .	1	['1']	1
I'll give you a ride back to the chancery .	8	['8']	8
You're gonna die .	1, 3	['1', ' 3']	1
After that we found out that it wasn't the Russians .	3	['3']	3
Tonight's the night .	2	['2']	2
I still killed three women .	3, 6	['3', ' 6']	3
Because I want to .	8, 1, 2, 3	['8', ' 1', ' 2', ' 3']	8
What the hell are you doing ? - [PERSON] !	1, 7	['1', ' 7']	1
This is not a good place for you .	6	['6']	6
Get out ! If you don't get out , I'm gonna go !	1, 4	['1', ' 4']	1
Want to be a hero , yeah ?	8, 2	['8', ' 2']	8

You too , buster , no sense in us all goin' noble .	1	['1']	1

Well , make up a time . You know , a time like you know .	1	['1']	1
You'll go on without me .	6	['6']	6
[PERSON]'s looking for a new assistant and wants to meet you for a drink .	2	['2']	2
Keep the line straight !	1	['1']	1
Do what he says .	1	['1']	1
Would that have satisfied her ? What's that ?	2	['2']	2
Come on now , let's go home .	8	['8']	8
Wouldn't you say that prison is my fate ?	4, 6	['4', ' 6']	4
Take him away , and the others , too !	1	['1']	1
Don't listen to him or we'll all be slaughtered .	1	['1']	1
We're in this thing together .	8	['8']	8
If you think I'm the kind to mess with anybody comes along ...	1	['1']	1
That's great , eh ?	5	['5']	5
I wouldn't want anybody to think I wasn't hospitable .	1	['1']	1
You've overlooked several other important details .	1	['1']	1
How cheerfully he seems to grin	5	['5']	5
Part of the family now .	8, 5	['8', ' 5']	8
Did I say something wrong ?	6	['6']	6
Oh , yeah .	8	['8']	8
Mills and [PERSON] won't last much longer .	6	['6']	6
And we learned a lot from you .	8	['8']	8
You are all welcome to drink the bar dry .	5	['5']	5
Today you are full - fledged ensigns .	8, 2, 5	['8', ' 2', ' 5']	8
Another miracle will happen .	2	['2']	2
I beg your pardon ? I leave tomorrow morning for [LOCATION] .	1	['1']	1
So the millionaire speculator is turning respectable .	3	['3']	3
It's essential that they take pride in their job .	5	['5']	5
Let's just win the game .	2	['2']	2
It's her !	4, 5, 7	['4', ' 5', ' 7']	4
If he called , I'd tell you .	8	['8']	8
I'm not afraid of you .	1	['1']	1
It seems there's no formal contract between you and [LOCATION] .	6	['6']	6
I was a child .	6	['6']	6
There's more where that came from .	2	['2']	2
He promised you parts in Cats ?	7	['7']	7
I wasn't anywhere near here !	1	['1']	1
You don't got ta love it , you just got ta do it .	8, 4	['8', ' 4']	8
Get me out of here .	4	['4']	4
Boy , did we have a great camping trip !	8, 5	['8', ' 5']	8
Like staying here all night uninvited .	3	['3']	3
You don't look excited .	6	['6']	6
Such vanity .	3	['3']	3
I'm not usually this fragile .	6	['6']	6
You're the prettiest woman in the room , sweetheart .	5	['5']	5
Let go ! Hey , get off of me .	1	['1']	1
You made the spell and you can undo it !	1	['1']	1
Good old Swayback .	8	['8']	8
We got to do something or it'll be too late .	4	['4']	4
I don't want to talk to him . I'll call him Monday .	1	['1']	1
I'll tell my mother !	1	['1']	1
You shot Mr. [PERSON] !	7	['7']	7
We've heard from Kennedy Approach that we've run into a traffic problem .	4	['4']	4

It doesn't fear my incantations !	4	['4']	4
I can't keep him . He's getting farther away .	6	['6']	6
Wait ! Wait right here !	1, 4	['1', ' 4']	1

Break every mirror in the palace .	1	['1']	1
We'll say farewell to [PERSON]	6	['6']	6
Yeah , I just wanted to talk to you .	8, 2	['8', ' 2']	8
Black powder and worse ...	3	['3']	3
He had a bad moustache , a lot of bad habits .	3	['3']	3
And I give him chance to speak : I will be the soul of the discretion .	2	['2']	2
But what's wrong with Sister [PERSON]'s habit ?	7	['7']	7
And that's the one thing that can make Mr. [PERSON] fly all the way here from [LOCATION] .	2	['2']	2
The man with the sweat was more pleasant than you .	3	['3']	3
And when it comes time for her to marry ... well , she'll be a little princess .	2	['2']	2
I hope it's gonna be a hit .	2	['2']	2
This is real nice .	5	['5']	5
For a buck , you get a shooter , and a cigar , and a dance with the beautiful bride .	5	['5']	5
Get in here , come on .	8, 5	['8', ' 5']	8
You are now different .	3	['3']	3

Did you have a warrant to search his trunk ?	1	['1']	1
We'll share it .	8	['8']	8
I know how much that hurts .	8	['8']	8
So me and my partner bolt up the stairs , somebody is screaming bloody murder ...	4	['4']	4
They do not want to separate of you .	8	['8']	8
[PERSON]'s going in there and lend a little comfort to the prisoners .	2	['2']	2
What you're dealing with is over your head .	1	['1']	1
It's a little foggy that you're pissed about 'cause I thought -- ´	7	['7']	7
How do I plead ?	4	['4']	4
[PERSON] ? No , we are a gang without money .	1	['1']	1
You humiliated him again .	3	['3']	3

Shut up and get your ass here !	1	['1']	1
The queen is never powerless .	8	['8']	8

It is not usually he writes to me .	2	['2']	2
How long do you think we'll have to stay in this hellhole ?	3	['3']	3
Yes , I was responsible .	8	['8']	8
It sometimes never goes away . How you talk .	6	['6']	6
Hi , [LOCATION] . Can you put [PERSON] back on , please ?	2	['2']	2
So , you're just going to let this woman blackmail you without a fight ?	1, 3	['1', ' 3']	1
It was good therapy after my divorce and my miscarriages .	8	['8']	8
I think we cured you .	2, 5	['2', ' 5']	2
She went in there to find the Hope Diamond . Just because she came out with a piece of glass doesn't mean it wasn't fraud .	4, 6	['4', ' 6']	4

Whoa , look at that .	7	['7']	7
You could run a few thousand volts through him .	1, 2	['1', ' 2']	1
Fight for real !	1, 6	['1', ' 6']	1
Skepticism is very healthy .	8	['8']	8
He's enjoying it ! Can't you see he's enjoying it ?	5	['5']	5
Because you were right about [PERSON] .	8	['8']	8
Please , this job means everything to me .	4	['4']	4
Want to get the fuck out of here ?	1, 2	['1', ' 2']	1
Nobody's gonna ruin the union !	1	['1']	1

With your permission , I'd like to show you something I've had printed .	2	['2']	2
Give him a break , would you ?	1, 3	['1', ' 3']	1
It wasn't because there weren't women that stirred my blood .	5	['5']	5
Hey , wait for me .	4	['4']	4
Sounds great , but what is it ?	7	['7']	7
I didn't say that .	1	['1']	1

It is very simple .	5	['5']	5
Throw him in the car .	1	['1']	1
You were going to give me that statue .	2, 6	['2', ' 6']	2
I'm pleased that we're having this closed executive session .	5	['5']	5

You seem personally invested in this .	2, 7	['2', ' 7']	2
Think I should go out with [PERSON] ?	8, 2, 7	['8', ' 2', ' 7']	8
The silly little girl wanted to give her kind of a party .	3	['3']	3
I've been called a lot of things , but  comfortable  !	7	['7']	7
Not unless you're crazy , baby , and crazy you are not .	8	['8']	8
Can't they find him ?	4	['4']	4
They had ten ... twenty of them in the back of this panel truck .	6	['6']	6

What the fuck are you trying to do ?	1	['1']	1
Who do you think you're talking to . Shut up and go back to work .	1	['1']	1
Ladies and gentlemen , these photos depict horrors ...	3, 4	['3', ' 4']	3
Then what are you gonna come home to ?	6	['6']	6

Need a little help .	8	['8']	8
And so I turned away my head and wept .	6	['6']	6
I'll get some help !	8, 4	['8', ' 4']	8
[PERSON] is army from the anus up .	5	['5']	5
You're mistaken if you think I'm leaving her here ... with a mother who doesn't consider her reputation .	3	['3']	3
Here , here , here . Oh - la - la .	5	['5']	5
I'm dead . I'm the walking dead . Are you gonna kill him or not ?	1, 2	['1', ' 2']	1

He kept expecting a bolt of lightning to come out of of the sky and strike him dead .	4	['4']	4
Let's stay just a little longer .	2	['2']	2
The brain surface neurons in this area have also been traumatised .	6	['6']	6
Hold him !	1, 2	['1', ' 2']	1
Okay , I have to study Returns and Exchanges .	1, 2	['1', ' 2']	1
Are you willing to fight , men ?	8	['8']	8

Harry . Remember how you used to say life wrote lousy scripts ?	2	['2']	2
You clean up real nice .	7	['7']	7
If he said they're here , they'll be here .	8	['8']	8
That you don't want to live here , or in [LOCATION] , or [LOCATION] , or any other place where people have to live on top of each other , and they don't have enough room to walk , or breath , or smile .	3	['3']	3
But you must admit that this doomed old civilization sparkles .	5	['5']	5
Excuse me ...	1, 4	['1', ' 4']	1
I have to spend half my life waiting for these time clocks to open .	6	['6']	6
And we know how to do that , don't we boy ?	8	['8']	8
And that we have an uncorrupted scientific establishment , which we do not and which we will prove .	6, 7	['6', ' 7']	6
Fifteen hundred ?	7	['7']	7
I hardly number pirates among my acquaintances .	3	['3']	3

I made it ashore , but I got separated from the other survivors .	4	['4']	4
But I won't know till tomorrow , along about noon .	2	['2']	2
No good asking you !	1	['1']	1
When a man like Senator [PERSON] gets up and swears that I've been robbing kids of nickels and dimes .	4	['4']	4
Don't be fresh , dear .	1, 3	['1', ' 3']	1
What're you gonna do with me ?	4	['4']	4

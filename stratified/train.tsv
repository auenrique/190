No you can bring that back .	1	['1']	1
The red blood lust ! What else could it be ?	1, 4	['1', ' 4']	1
In the end , we would be masters of a wrecked and hungry planet .	6	['6']	6
The Presidential Commission has empowered me to take it in my care .	8	['8']	8
I gave him my compartment . He only had coach seats .	5	['5']	5
Hey , trust me with your life but not your money or your wife . You're an asshole !	1, 3	['1', ' 3']	1
Okay , we'll do it , but I want to hear [PERSON]'s voice , and I mean now .	1	['1']	1
The [PERSON]'s a floating mistake .	8	['8']	8
Drained their life savings , ruined hundreds of lives , and made off with over $ million .	1, 3	['1', ' 3']	1
I killed this person for their money , right ?	7	['7']	7
I'll do everything I can to make a success of it .	2	['2']	2
I'm sorry that I could not divulge the truth to you of all men .	6	['6']	6
I sit here and I can't believe that it happened .	7	['7']	7
[PERSON] was never supposed to talk to him .	1, 3, 6	['1', ' 3', ' 6']	1
Well , I still want him for that train robbery up at [LOCATION] .	3	['3']	3
It must be in your genes .	5	['5']	5
I don't know what I'd ...	1, 6, 7	['1', ' 6', ' 7']	1
Mr. [PERSON] , are you opposing me ?	1	['1']	1
Hurry back .	2, 4	['2', ' 4']	2
Get anything yet ?	2	['2']	2
Are we ?	2	['2']	2
She tried to kill me because I told her about Nately .	4	['4']	4
What is not going to be easy ?	3, 6, 7	['3', ' 6', ' 7']	3
[PERSON] won't see her kids again .	6	['6']	6
Good morning .	5	['5']	5
They can't fire both of us , right ?	4	['4']	4
Does it mean you want me to go there ?	7	['7']	7
Could you guys shut up in there ?	1	['1']	1
She's never cared for me .	6	['6']	6
All that bread and livin' in a dump like this . Smashed cars , busted - out buses ... but all good stashes .	6	['6']	6
She wore a ribbon , and always had white dresses .	8	['8']	8
Sweetheart , look what just came in the mail for you .	8, 2, 5	['8', ' 2', ' 5']	8
Now he was going to pry it open .	7	['7']	7
How come you just didn't have a baby ?	1, 7	['1', ' 7']	1
You're not that person anymore .	6	['6']	6
Maybe I'm tired of one - night stands .	6	['6']	6
Someone gathered the powders to sleep to the tonic ?	7	['7']	7
Good . Yeah .	8, 5	['8', ' 5']	8
Well , I think it would be a crime if you didn't participate .	3	['3']	3
Incredible .	7	['7']	7
You got something to say about our plan ?	1	['1']	1
You still workin' on that deal ?	7	['7']	7
I'm sorry , Grandfather . I've got to get some air .	3, 6	['3', ' 6']	3
Man , what are you , some kind of frog - watcher ?	3	['3']	3
You can't do this ...	1	['1']	1
Mom , [PERSON] died .	6	['6']	6
Is Mommy going to be all right ?	4	['4']	4
I can't take any more of it .	6	['6']	6
Sorry . - Sorry to wake you .	6	['6']	6
No , I think it's a lot more exciting than that .	8, 2, 5	['8', ' 2', ' 5']	8
In the final analysis , all we're trying to do is create a happy world .	5	['5']	5
[PERSON] , don't go to him !	4	['4']	4
Not my book , anyway .	1	['1']	1
I just saved your life , and you still don't trust me ?	7	['7']	7
What the hell are you trying to do to me ?	1	['1']	1
Everything's ready	2	['2']	2
I'm sorry , sir .	6	['6']	6
Now that particular statement really pissed me off , because I don't think Congress did any such thing .	1, 3	['1', ' 3']	1
But , you see , it's really his wife that's keeping them apart .	6	['6']	6
I represent the belief of far more people .	8	['8']	8
There's nothing more wonderful than children playing , hearing them laughing .	8, 2, 5	['8', ' 2', ' 5']	8
By the time they take the mortgage payments out of my paycheck , there's not enough left to buy you a fuckin' box of tampons !	3	['3']	3
Watch your back .	4	['4']	4
You can hold the frog .	8	['8']	8
A heroic thought , Barley .	7	['7']	7
Are you still here ?	3	['3']	3
The Count says if it could be as soon as possible .	2	['2']	2
[PERSON] , give me a break , will you ?	1	['1']	1
You keep avoiding me .	6	['6']	6
Hsiao - tsing ? !	7	['7']	7
She seems very unusual . - Yeah .	3	['3']	3
I want to see it now !	2	['2']	2
I don't mean to be handing you no line , but that's pretty hard to believe .	7	['7']	7
Keep in touch .	8, 2	['8', ' 2']	8
How do you know it's not you .	7	['7']	7
What are the chances of finding that ?	7	['7']	7
[PERSON] , I'm not so sure about this .	2	['2']	2
Extra-terrestrial bodies , yes .	8	['8']	8
And he waded in there with a lead pipe and he saved your ass and now you're going to deny him over his dead body ?	1	['1']	1
You want me to talk with the Federal Bureau of Narcotics see if they have any problems ? Internal Revenue Service ?	3	['3']	3
I just had the weirdest dream .	7	['7']	7
Give me your blessing for a happy voyage .	8	['8']	8
As he said , it's against the rules .	1	['1']	1
Before we go , you must play the piano for us .	2	['2']	2
There's nothing wrong with missing people .	8	['8']	8
That's the unholy pity of it .	6	['6']	6
See you later , darling .	8, 5	['8', ' 5']	8
We're professionals , just like you .	4	['4']	4
It's a train robbery .	4	['4']	4
Poor [PERSON] never did have no luck with men .	6	['6']	6
Considering the candidates who answer to the high qualifications of senators , one name shone out like a beacon .	8	['8']	8
Paige ...	1, 3, 6	['1', ' 3', ' 6']	1
It was an accident .	4	['4']	4
I'll design a costume all by myself and give you the surprise of your life .	2	['2']	2
I hear you get a nice pension from the government after 20 , years .	5	['5']	5
I don't want to get shot .	4	['4']	4
He's complete now .	8, 5	['8', ' 5']	8
I adore it !	5	['5']	5
I get a kick out of being on the winning side for a change .	2, 5	['2', ' 5']	2
Say it , then , and get out !	1	['1']	1
By most standards , flying all the way to [LOCATION] to look for a new face would seem like going to a lot of trouble .	1, 7	['1', ' 7']	1
You even die for them .	8	['8']	8
Hurry up , students . Five more minutes for your pen - pals .	2	['2']	2
You don't get it , do you ?	1, 3	['1', ' 3']	1
[PERSON] , the baby ?	7	['7']	7
Awesome . This is rad .	5	['5']	5
I'm very pleased to meet you , sister [PERSON] .	5	['5']	5
It's a better world , we're all bound for .	8, 2	['8', ' 2']	8
Like private places , boy .	5	['5']	5
Just kiss my ass from now on .	1	['1']	1
That's what I pay you for .	1, 5	['1', ' 5']	1
I'm glad you're here to see nothing goes wrong .	8	['8']	8
Very well , I won't pry into trade secrets .	8	['8']	8
It's incredible stupidity ...	1, 6, 7	['1', ' 6', ' 7']	1
I'm a perfect surgeon .	5	['5']	5
Hastings , we will leave this , up to the lawyer of the Mrs. [PERSON] to be present .	4	['4']	4
Go home .	1, 3	['1', ' 3']	1
[PERSON] , you don't like this job any more than I do , do you ?	3	['3']	3
I can make a recess happen .	2	['2']	2
We'll show them you're not afraid .	1	['1']	1
I brought you something to drink .	8	['8']	8
They're hollow and empty .	3, 6	['3', ' 6']	3
He gave me some work to do and he left .	7	['7']	7
You know I talk to it sometimes , and I beg it to wake me up .	6, 7	['6', ' 7']	6
This is your problem .	1	['1']	1
I have rights .	1	['1']	1
Ah , he's peeing on me !	3	['3']	3
We have to give them something to hope for .	8	['8']	8
That's got it .	8	['8']	8
[PERSON] would get a shot every half hour so he could die without pain .	6	['6']	6
Did you do it ?	7	['7']	7
False alarms were common , And they didn't help our morale .	1	['1']	1
We were worried about [PERSON] .	4	['4']	4
There . Now it's perfect .	5	['5']	5
I've isolated her forever .	3	['3']	3
If I'd only figured it out before maybe we wouldn't have been trapped down here .	6	['6']	6
And nowhere is more dangerous than their local bar , the rat catcher .	4	['4']	4
It's nice to have company for tea .	5	['5']	5
I don't think I've seen you before .	7	['7']	7
If you die , your type will be extinct	6	['6']	6
He sweats gasoline that man !	3	['3']	3
I'm not available .	1, 3	['1', ' 3']	1
When did you discover that ?	7	['7']	7
Congratulations , [PERSON] .	8	['8']	8
Of course , you know that the first thing is to fall in love .	5	['5']	5
Right in the middle of our celebration ... the firebase got hit by a mortar attack .	4	['4']	4
I didn't know you were still here .	7	['7']	7
What am I gonna do when she has a baby ?	4	['4']	4
Listen to this .	2, 3	['2', ' 3']	2
Should I just stand around and let that drooling infant wrap that [LOCATION] dam appropriation around my neck ?	3	['3']	3
And if I kissed it ... and made a wish ... it'd come true .	2, 7	['2', ' 7']	2
Did you come to see me for the same reason as the man with sweat on his face ?	3	['3']	3
Don't bother to get up I'll take care of myself	1	['1']	1
You outclassed the bum , huh ?	8	['8']	8
You're really the tolerant type , [PERSON] !	7	['7']	7
Two good and happy years , for me at any rate . The night he fell to [LOCATION] ,	5	['5']	5
I will not do it .	1, 3, 5	['1', ' 3', ' 5']	1
You and me , we do business .	8	['8']	8
You did not bore me .	7	['7']	7
What was that crack ?	4	['4']	4
I was , up to the minute I saw this test .	1	['1']	1
I wanted to let you know that the ambulance was late in getting away .	6	['6']	6
How stupid of me !	1	['1']	1
So he goes out and he buys a bunch of roses .	2	['2']	2
I smell blood .	4	['4']	4
Ah , we're getting closer now to what happened ...	2, 5	['2', ' 5']	2
Let's go and see my cousin .	2	['2']	2
Will you let go of me !	1	['1']	1
I'll get my dinner .	2	['2']	2
Reel her in . Steady .	2	['2']	2
If I get the job , I'll buy you one hundred of 'em .	2	['2']	2
Are you drunk ?	3	['3']	3
I object to you coming here .	1	['1']	1
I'm not lying .	1, 6	['1', ' 6']	1
And you know what ? They offered us a job .	7	['7']	7
If I hurry , perhaps I might even be home in time for tea .	2	['2']	2
I mean , you said it yourself , [PERSON] . He's born for this .	8	['8']	8
What the hell happened in there ?	1, 7	['1', ' 7']	1
Hey , would you get a load of this joint ?	2	['2']	2
We don't understand .	6	['6']	6
Just look at this crowd .	3	['3']	3
I'm cold .	6	['6']	6
Don't leave me now .	4	['4']	4
I put the kettle on .	2	['2']	2
How good to see you !	5	['5']	5
The first little league in [LOCATION] with a dome .	5	['5']	5
He'll know what to do .	8	['8']	8
You don't have any messages for me , do you ?	2	['2']	2
Especially not to throw away your career with this team .	1, 3	['1', ' 3']	1
Where is your courage , Comrade [PERSON] ?	3	['3']	3
Why aren't they firing ?	4, 7	['4', ' 7']	4
Well , we'll figure something out .	8	['8']	8
That was the hope .	5	['5']	5
No - no - no - no ... now , see , half of my team is dead ... by your hand .	4, 6	['4', ' 6']	4
It's nice to have somebody to say goodbye to .	5	['5']	5
Come off a rumble , we'd beat the shit out of a gang .	1	['1']	1
Spent time making that , you know .	5	['5']	5
So that at least narrows down where they are right now .	5	['5']	5
They look like they've come to a funeral .	6	['6']	6
Of course , it's absurd that a priest would be involved .	7	['7']	7
Thirty years a Sheriff and all I've had to contend with are vicious animals .	1, 6	['1', ' 6']	1
Your whole story about how [PERSON] got his name on the door is bullshit !	1, 3	['1', ' 3']	1
So the basic problem is that I'm still around ?	1	['1']	1
I want some orange juice , eggs , bacon , toasted muffin and lots of coffee .	2	['2']	2
Well , because that makes sense .	2, 5	['2', ' 5']	2
How you going to stop me ?	1	['1']	1
I hope everything's going well with your marching .	8, 5	['8', ' 5']	8
Go on , [PERSON] .	2	['2']	2
We don't need any rush - hour Rambos there .	1	['1']	1
♪ And I think to myself ♪	5	['5']	5
I'll take you back and dump you .	1	['1']	1
Seems a shame to part company after all these years .	6	['6']	6
As far as I'm concerned , a coconut hit you on the mouth .	7	['7']	7
What a jerk .	1	['1']	1
I wanted to ask you a couple of questions .	2	['2']	2
Got ta have good nerves , though .	8	['8']	8
What are you smilin' at ?	1	['1']	1
He said again that the more early I was going away better .	1, 2, 4	['1', ' 2', ' 4']	1
Nitrates and phosphate for ammunition ... The seeds of war .	1, 2, 5	['1', ' 2', ' 5']	1
If he starts convincing those senators , you might as well blow your brains out !	4	['4']	4
Why don't we have a drink for old time's sake ?	2, 5	['2', ' 5']	2
They all coldcocked me .	1, 6	['1', ' 6']	1
Yeah , going public will not help you , or me .	2, 4	['2', ' 4']	2
Or didn't you think magicians could fall in love ?	2	['2']	2
And no one will believe me .	6	['6']	6
Poor child .	6	['6']	6
But there's the challenge .	4	['4']	4
I think it was a bowie knife , and I hate knives .	1, 2	['1', ' 2']	1
[PERSON] , how are you ?	8, 2	['8', ' 2']	8
We just have to find someone else with more sense .	3	['3']	3
Hey , since when have you ever ?	1	['1']	1
[PERSON] , my dear fellow , I know just exactly what you have in mind , and I couldn't agree with you more .	8, 5	['8', ' 5']	8
Just one ?	7	['7']	7
I was only trying to be nice to make her feel good .	6	['6']	6
That's it !	1	['1']	1
How much do you think he heard ?	4	['4']	4
[PERSON] was the fireball of our little cocoon .	8, 5	['8', ' 5']	8
Let's get rolling , man .	2	['2']	2
All other movements are restricted .	1, 2	['1', ' 2']	1
I bet you've known a lot of lawyers .	2	['2']	2
Of course I'm sweating , you moron .	3	['3']	3
You have the most unusual name , too .	7	['7']	7
Who would want to live in a graveyard ?	3, 7	['3', ' 7']	3
Turned out that my father and his business partner were involved in a Ponzi scheme .	1, 3	['1', ' 3']	1
But they began spreading wild rumours about steaming in circles . -	1, 4	['1', ' 4']	1
Let's go give that cop a bad time .	1, 2, 3, 5	['1', ' 2', ' 3', ' 5']	1
They would be bugging your phone , surveilling you hours a day , and they wouldn't have tipped you by sending [PERSON] . I -	4	['4']	4
That's right , sister .	8	['8']	8
But I can't play them with you .	6	['6']	6
Hurry up , suckers , you're dragging !	3	['3']	3
That isn't enough .	1, 6	['1', ' 6']	1
They all point to me .	4	['4']	4
And then I - I don't know what happened .	6	['6']	6
So you do not recognize me ?	6, 7	['6', ' 7']	6
Nobody messes with the Healys !	1	['1']	1
Something is breeding there . Underneath the cemetery .	4	['4']	4
Back to Righteous villa ? It's haunted !	4	['4']	4
Besides I can't -- l can't afford to lose bucks .	4	['4']	4
The way you've ignored us , you wouldn't think so .	3	['3']	3
Heavens , no !	4	['4']	4
I have risen to a difficult task .	4	['4']	4
I don't think he killed [PERSON] .	8	['8']	8
They can't get us in Hole in the Wall .	1, 4	['1', ' 4']	1
I'm not surprised . Me , too .	1, 4, 6	['1', ' 4', ' 6']	1
If a sorcerer's house isn't his castle , what is it ?	1, 2, 4, 7	['1', ' 2', ' 4', ' 7']	1
We'll get there .	2	['2']	2
She said that I put on airs . That I use big words like gesture  and  devastate .  	1, 3, 6	['1', ' 3', ' 6']	1
I suppose she means well .	4, 6	['4', ' 6']	4

Leave me alone !	1	['1']	1
What a man !	7	['7']	7
A deal is impossible .	4	['4']	4

What , are you guys blind or something ?	1	['1']	1
The moving finger had already writ and moved on , and nothing I could do would have canceled half a line , nor would my tears wash out a word of it .	6	['6']	6

Take care of you .	2	['2']	2

A man I've admired and worshipped all my life .	5	['5']	5
Fuck them !	1	['1']	1
Yes , I'll be with you in a minute , Mr. [PERSON] !	2	['2']	2
I say I can not play a scene , and you say , Play it .  	1	['1']	1
But , [PERSON] , he dresses like the man that cremated Uncle [PERSON] .	3	['3']	3
And with the telling , it became easier .	5	['5']	5
Now .	2	['2']	2
Am I a criminal for that ?	4	['4']	4
We tried that route , but we gave up .	6	['6']	6
May I see it ?	2	['2']	2
Go get them and get them quick !	4	['4']	4
I'll be okay .	2, 5	['2', ' 5']	2
Her boyfriend was killed in a racing accident .	6	['6']	6
What's it to you ?	1	['1']	1
They're going to nail us , no matter what we do .	4	['4']	4

You don't have to thank me .	8	['8']	8
Glad you liked it , Grandfather .	5	['5']	5
You can not tolerate the faith in humanity , Because if you do , all this ... The structure of your very existence ,	6	['6']	6
I guess one gets the face one deserves .	6	['6']	6
I was in that room !	1	['1']	1
You're happy all the time ?	7	['7']	7
You sound further away than that .	7	['7']	7
Can it be that I'm falling in love with you ?	7	['7']	7
I was lucky I come across her last .	7	['7']	7
I won't let it happen .	1	['1']	1
Because he was a great kisser .	5	['5']	5
I've been aboard the [PERSON] too long .	3, 6	['3', ' 6']	3
Time's getting short .	2	['2']	2
I am exhausted .	6	['6']	6
He used to make me bend over while he whipped me with his belt .	4	['4']	4
What's this Chicken Volavent ?	7	['7']	7
The point is , the miracle has happened and a great career is yours for the asking .	5	['5']	5
I was too nervous .	4	['4']	4
My God .	1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7	['1', ' 3', ' 4', ' 5', ' 6', ' 7']	1
Nobody cares .	1, 3	['1', ' 3']	1

I didn't mean to oversell .	4	['4']	4
Think fast .	2	['2']	2
[PERSON] , I'm not interested in this . Of course you're not .	6	['6']	6
For chrissake , where did she come up with [PERSON] ?	1	['1']	1
That extension was a power of attorney , [PERSON] !	1	['1']	1
There are demons in the court so I must get involved in affairs of state	2	['2']	2
I seem to be spoiling everybody's brandy and cigars ... and dreams of victory .	6	['6']	6
I'm just not up to my usual self .	6	['6']	6
If there's any decency in you ...	3	['3']	3
Then take my advice .	8	['8']	8
We got 'em again !	1	['1']	1
No , not tonight .	3	['3']	3
I deeded him the land and he guaranteed me half of what he got if he made the sale .	8	['8']	8
That ought to teach those [LOCATION] to stay away from my house .	3	['3']	3
Buy it or wreck it !	1	['1']	1
God save the Queen !	8, 5	['8', ' 5']	8
Come on , [PERSON] . We got ta move !	1	['1']	1
[PERSON] is a friend of mine .	8	['8']	8

I hate myself for not using cutaways .	6	['6']	6
I need to send my thumbprint so they know it's me .	8, 2	['8', ' 2']	8
So I phoned Mr [PERSON] and he agreed to pick it up .	8	['8']	8
Yeah . I'm okay .	8	['8']	8
Well ?	2, 3	['2', ' 3']	2
Would you like to come with me and look for her ?	8	['8']	8
There . You see ? Someone else who knows that it's wrong .	2, 4	['2', ' 4']	2
We have a tremendous audience here At global television studios ,	2	['2']	2
And then one day I went into the barn ... and there he was .	2, 3, 7	['2', ' 3', ' 7']	2
How much time did we lose , exactly ?	2, 7	['2', ' 7']	2
Do you understand now why it is so important to me for you to believe that I love you with all of my heart ?	5	['5']	5
Is it ... and look who's there !	5, 7	['5', ' 7']	5
No , no , they don't .	1, 7	['1', ' 7']	1

Yo , [PERSON] . Hey , how you doing ?	2	['2']	2
Oh , it's swell !	5, 7	['5', ' 7']	5

They will believe you .	8	['8']	8
Ah ! - You should listen to your brother .	1, 7	['1', ' 7']	1
Like myself , it struggled blindly for the means to live .	6	['6']	6
Why do you hate everybody ?	8, 1, 6, 7	['8', ' 1', ' 6', ' 7']	8
Yeah , everything's great .	5	['5']	5

Melancholy sight .	6	['6']	6
Do you know , you were pretty cute in there today , my little .	5	['5']	5
We'll let him sleep .	8	['8']	8
It's a liability .	6	['6']	6
That's very inspirational , [PERSON] .	5	['5']	5
But you do remember this , don't you ?	1	['1']	1
That I had to chew his ass to get him to move on it . He seemed more interested in if , when and how ... I was fucking [PERSON] than in his own investigation .	3	['3']	3
Those men hadn't even thought of that .	7	['7']	7
It must be difficult to let go of something so beautiful .	6, 7	['6', ' 7']	6
No complaints , you're reliable -	8	['8']	8
He's not making a whole lot of sense .	3	['3']	3
I thought you were ...	7	['7']	7
Ah , ah , I'm so sorry . [PERSON] has nothing to do with this .	8, 3, 6	['8', ' 3', ' 6']	8
Quickly !	2, 4, 7	['2', ' 4', ' 7']	2

And I'll tell you all about that job .	2	['2']	2
From my heart , I thank you .	8	['8']	8

She looks French , sure .	2	['2']	2
Your parents have been calling all day long .	1	['1']	1
and on my wedding night , to wait for him with my heart full of love .	2	['2']	2
Mr. [PERSON] knows perfectly well the witness is unable to answer that question .	6, 7	['6', ' 7']	6
We , the hunted , will now hunt !	1	['1']	1
Somethin' wrong with your car ?	2, 4, 6, 7	['2', ' 4', ' 6', ' 7']	2
But it's wonderful .	5	['5']	5
Jealousy can be destructive .	6	['6']	6
If you don't mind , you owe me two more for tiring out my cattle .	1	['1']	1
We must get everyone in [LOCATION] to help us .	2, 4	['2', ' 4']	2
I wouldn't take the slightest risk now you've made such a great reputation for yourself in the Senate .	4	['4']	4
How'd they know you were on this train ?	7	['7']	7
It's time to make a move .	2	['2']	2
You're not making my job any easier .	1	['1']	1

You see how much we accomplish when you appear ?	5	['5']	5
The water's great !	5	['5']	5

I'll fire you . I'll leave you on the goddamn tarmac .	1, 3	['1', ' 3']	1
I didn't jump .	7	['7']	7
Maybe you should have thought of that before you sent her to rob my client .	1, 3	['1', ' 3']	1
[PERSON] says he didn't rent a car . The rental company says he did . Whatever .	6	['6']	6
Next , please .	2	['2']	2
You aren't even allowed to look at her with her clothes on .	3	['3']	3
Find out where he hides them deeds and all the stuff he's been stealin' .	3	['3']	3
If we close , our stock won't be worth a nickel .	4	['4']	4
It means I haven't forgotten whose court I'm on .	1	['1']	1
May success follow your flag .	2, 5	['2', ' 5']	2
You know , the four fragile fingers , and the long arm , real short joint .	1	['1']	1

Your hands are sunburned , aren't they ?	7	['7']	7
I'm not blind .	1	['1']	1
Don't come back here  - that's a bit like saying :  Do not read this note  . 	3	['3']	3
I can't wait to see that [PERSON] .	2	['2']	2
You haven't got a little nip of something , have you ?	8	['8']	8
They send me home a hero and I say wonderful things about them back in the [LOCATION] .	5	['5']	5
Hey , these are keen !	7	['7']	7

No sweat .	8	['8']	8
I have more power in this hand than all you fucking know .	8, 2	['8', ' 2']	8
And as long as you've got this wedding ring on , you've got me .	8	['8']	8
I know a place that does a good breakfast .	5	['5']	5

Let them look .	8	['8']	8
See , Congress is no different than the rest of the country .	1, 3	['1', ' 3']	1
Things usually change for the better .	5	['5']	5
It's more than my job's worth !	1, 7	['1', ' 7']	1

And that scares the shit out of me , kid .	4	['4']	4
Ms. [PERSON] ... everybody has a secret face .	7	['7']	7
We brought enough beef for [LOCATION]'s people to get by .	5	['5']	5
I wanted to blame myself for my dad's drinking , for my mom's crying all the time and her emotional breakdown .	6	['6']	6
You stay and cook one of your raw dinners .	3	['3']	3
It gives me great pleasure to introduce to you , [PERSON] .	8, 5	['8', ' 5']	8
You don't have to hold yourself back anymore , [PERSON] .	2, 5	['2', ' 5']	2
Police are about to release a statement about the circumstances of her death ...	6	['6']	6
I'm trying to find some peace with this and you're not helping .	1	['1']	1

Time could not mar the perfect symmetry of those walls .	5	['5']	5
We've still got her , don't we , [PERSON] ? Oh , yeah .	2	['2']	2
But they don't know that I intend to attack them without mercy .	1	['1']	1
It ain't safe to go that way ...	4	['4']	4
Is that the only word your mind can understand ?	3	['3']	3
We need good cops , and they say you're good at what you do .	8	['8']	8
I'm gonna get that bastard .	3	['3']	3
Bad guys are long gone .	8	['8']	8
You're saying that someone made it look as if it had been forced from the outside ?	7	['7']	7
Do you know anything about them ?	2	['2']	2
Naughty , Pumpkin !	1	['1']	1
Why aren't you helping [PERSON] with my surprise birthday party ?	7	['7']	7
I mean , didn't you feel like A complete piece of gutless , spineless , Primordial slime ?	3	['3']	3
Well , that's not a very even trade .	7	['7']	7
Don't worry . A couple more years , and [PERSON] will be a speed freak like us old - timers .	2	['2']	2
This is only the tip of the iceberg , as hundreds more have given us their testimony , but are too fearful to go on camera for fear of repercussions for themselves and for their families .	6	['6']	6
Fucking cops always forget something .	1, 3	['1', ' 3']	1
You won't have any money after the rangers get through with you .	1, 2	['1', ' 2']	1

That's a good idea .	8, 5	['8', ' 5']	8
Will you help us , please ?	8	['8']	8
Sorry about that .	6	['6']	6
The cops didn't give you trouble , did they ?	2	['2']	2
Get the fuck out of this country .	1	['1']	1

I've got cookies !	5	['5']	5
[PERSON] , sic him !	4	['4']	4
If they don't they may learn to appreciate it , but it will never become part of their soul .	3	['3']	3
Listen , I got ta go to work now .	2	['2']	2
You saying I got no brains ?	1	['1']	1
I don't believe it !	1	['1']	1
You don't believe that stuff , do you ?	7	['7']	7
They did the smash - and - grab , she was gonna tell the feds .	6	['6']	6
Why didn't you take her home ?	7	['7']	7
Trubel ?	7	['7']	7
Did the Lord say : His Pa is a sinner and not meant to be happy ?  - No . 	1	['1']	1
Are you happy now , yeah ?	1	['1']	1
The committee wishes to emphasise that there is no evidence of any wider conspiracy .	8	['8']	8

The State calls Detective [PERSON] .	2	['2']	2
That is ridiculous .	1, 3	['1', ' 3']	1
How can you say such a thing ?	1	['1']	1
One day , you're going to make a slip . All this wealth you've got won't check against my list .	2	['2']	2
Oh , it's just surprising .	7	['7']	7
Your Ma's in a coffin being eaten by worms .	1, 3	['1', ' 3']	1

You know that the child of two primitive apes will never learn how to speak .	3	['3']	3
You're not easy to talk to on the phone , so I decided to ambush you .	2	['2']	2
This is just horrible .	4, 6	['4', ' 6']	4

It's funny .	5	['5']	5
Hey , baby .	5	['5']	5
Don't you see me standing right here ?	1	['1']	1
Your idea of a chance at him was uncorroborated statements from an informant who was doing hard time and who would sell his own mother to get his sentence reduced .	1	['1']	1
You may believe what you like .	1	['1']	1
I'll talk to him .	8	['8']	8
Don't fuck with me , you know ?	1	['1']	1
It makes my heart sad .	6	['6']	6

A battleship might be more comforting .	8, 2	['8', ' 2']	8
Oh no . Shit ! [PERSON] !	4	['4']	4
Where is this manuscript ?	2	['2']	2
My career will be ruined .	4	['4']	4
If I'm going to vote , I ought to study some of the bills .	2	['2']	2
Hmm , it's a nice place .	5	['5']	5
What good is it to cut off your heads ?	3	['3']	3
You can not kill a man's family and talk about human rights .	1, 3	['1', ' 3']	1

Considering who's in the compound , my guess is it's going to be heavily guarded .	2	['2']	2
I can grow another one in a week .	2, 5	['2', ' 5']	2
And I want a list of everybody's budgets , research accounts and financials on my desk by tomorrow .	1	['1']	1
Didn't I tell ya some day he'd turn on ya ?	4	['4']	4
The reality however is much different .	4	['4']	4
Why not destroy senor [PERSON] ?	2	['2']	2
I had to sweat blood to get that .	6	['6']	6
I slaved for you for over ten years without even a raise or a promotion .	1, 6	['1', ' 6']	1
The sunsets were pink ...	4	['4']	4
And as for taxes , how many millions have you in tax - exempt bonds and oil wells , whose power of production your government so generously protects , while it denies similar benefits to the human brain ?	3	['3']	3
Then once you cross [LOCATION] , you're scot - free , that is until ... Dead Dingo Pass .	2, 4	['2', ' 4']	2
But problems don't just go , [PERSON] , you know ?	6	['6']	6
I still need it when I'm afraid , like a baby who needs a light on in the dark .	8, 3, 4, 6	['8', ' 3', ' 4', ' 6']	8

What the hell are we doing here ?	1	['1']	1
At that rate , we only have three weeks .	4	['4']	4
We're going to start with the high board .	2	['2']	2
A marriage bed is made for two , but every damn morning , it's the woman who has to make it .	3	['3']	3
I'm on my way back to [PERSON] .	2	['2']	2
She's with me now , whitebread .	1, 3	['1', ' 3']	1

Cheers !	2, 5	['2', ' 5']	2
Give me a minute .	1	['1']	1
One car behind us . - Let's go there .	2	['2']	2
I'm sure you don't mean that .	6	['6']	6
Now that's ... not a great deal of effort for more money than you ever dreamed of . And no risk ... no risk to you at all .	1, 2, 3	['1', ' 2', ' 3']	1
But no more odd , surely , than my driving away that day , away from her , knowing that , inevitably , we would meet again .	8	['8']	8
If this is an escape route , why didn't you escape long ago ?	2, 7	['2', ' 7']	2
I want my $ 200 !	1	['1']	1
No , you're not listening to me !	1, 6	['1', ' 6']	1
The clerk said she left with one of those two Cuban Hebes .	4, 7	['4', ' 7']	4

It's all right .	8, 5	['8', ' 5']	8
It should be fun doing some detective work .	8, 2, 5	['8', ' 2', ' 5']	8
Where'd they go ?	2, 7	['2', ' 7']	2
In your case , I wanted to test your loyalty to your companions .	8	['8']	8
Things like this create a bad feeling .	6	['6']	6
Well , I love a drink .	5	['5']	5
Dorcas , it brings me stamps , please .	1, 3	['1', ' 3']	1
I'm sorry about your father .	6	['6']	6

That's a weapon in your world ?	7	['7']	7
You forgot your shoes .	7	['7']	7
You can not come to the hospital , [LOCATION] .	6	['6']	6
There's a certain amount of hurry up involved here . My life is in danger . Three ten .	4	['4']	4
If [PERSON] sees a phone company subpoena , now , she'll bust a gut .	4	['4']	4
I know .	8, 5	['8', ' 5']	8
Morning . - Hey , babe !	8, 5	['8', ' 5']	8
Couldn't agree with you more , Mr. [PERSON] .	8	['8']	8

But she can't say that , which means all [PERSON] stole was a meaningless stack of papers .	2	['2']	2
No . - Really not ?	2, 4, 6, 7	['2', ' 4', ' 6', ' 7']	2
Death everywhere and you and me in the middle .	8, 6	['8', ' 6']	8
I'd never have taken the job if I hadn't wanted to keep us all together .	8	['8']	8
You taught me a lesson , man .	8	['8']	8
You proud to have that animal for kin ?	1, 3	['1', ' 3']	1

What about dynamite ?	7	['7']	7
Let me talk to her . Let me just talk to her .	2, 4	['2', ' 4']	2
That wheel is enough to drive anybody crazy .	1	['1']	1
I. . . didn't think I'd ever see you again .	7	['7']	7
I wanted to hurt a pimp . That's what I wanted to do .	1, 3, 6	['1', ' 3', ' 6']	1
Too bad about those eggs , [PERSON] .	8, 4	['8', ' 4']	8
There's nothing more commercial than a long - shot comeback of a down - on - his - luck underdog .	1, 3	['1', ' 3']	1
I regret the things that I done .	3, 6	['3', ' 6']	3
My life now only has room for truth .	8, 2	['8', ' 2']	8
I didn't recognize you standing up .	7	['7']	7
She had my finger , you know ...	6	['6']	6
I'm not gonna sit here and be accused of things without any evidence !	1	['1']	1
Will you take me away from here ?	2	['2']	2
Are you dumb ?	1	['1']	1
Really , I've never been happier .	5	['5']	5
Do all directors come to ask young women to sit with their producers ? Um , not all .	7	['7']	7

No pension plan , no insurance .	1, 6	['1', ' 6']	1
Yes sir , the thrill of the open road .	2, 5	['2', ' 5']	2

Or we have a problem with the judges .	4	['4']	4
Father [PERSON] told me that you had to keep your hands to yourself .	6, 7	['6', ' 7']	6
I like him so much .	8, 5, 7	['8', ' 5', ' 7']	8
In that case , why don't you go to that last table ... sit down , shut up , and don't move ?	1	['1']	1
We'll just go and have a great time anyway , huh ?	5	['5']	5
I'm paralysed with happiness !	5	['5']	5
I hadn't spoken to him in and a half years .	2	['2']	2
I don't want this !	7	['7']	7
It's a matter of life and death !	1, 4	['1', ' 4']	1
There must be somewhere in [LOCATION] where one can find sanctuary to think .	1, 3	['1', ' 3']	1

I want the whole morning edition a blast to push him off the floor .	1	['1']	1
Forgive me , Father , for I have sinned .	6	['6']	6
How much time has the world got ?	4	['4']	4

With the transit trouble , I didn't expect to see you on time .	7	['7']	7
Absolutely .	8, 5	['8', ' 5']	8
You have literature , art treasures , My collections , and even music if you so desire .	2	['2']	2
Father , maybe we could ... Go in the other room and speak privately ?	4	['4']	4
He's wrong for us .	3, 4, 6, 7	['3', ' 4', ' 6', ' 7']	3
Oh yeah ? You wan na tell me why ?	1	['1']	1
Apollo won't know what hit him .	2	['2']	2
They won't care about one girl when thousands die every day .	1	['1']	1
Ha ha !	7	['7']	7
A traitor !	1, 3	['1', ' 3']	1
You are defeated but you have no shame .	3	['3']	3
The general talked about killing the president .	3, 4, 7	['3', ' 4', ' 7']	3

I'm gonna take you to a nice , quiet place .	8	['8']	8
Do something with yourself for pity's sakes .	1, 3, 7	['1', ' 3', ' 7']	1
I know you were deeply touched by [PERSON]'s gesture ,	5	['5']	5
I knew someone would get killed , but nobody listened .	1, 4, 6	['1', ' 4', ' 6']	1
More chanting ! Father !	2, 5	['2', ' 5']	2
And , uh , I love to experience pleasure .	2, 5	['2', ' 5']	2
I can't tell you how glad I am to see you .	5	['5']	5
But even so , it is quite awful when nobody in loves , is not ?	6	['6']	6
Everything's fine .	5	['5']	5
If it were our plane , it'd be crashing .	1	['1']	1
Doctor , how long has this stuff been going on ?	4	['4']	4
All I want to do is make things as difficult as possible .	1	['1']	1

This doesn't make sense .	7	['7']	7
You look so pretty .	5	['5']	5
When were you going to give the money to the community ?	1	['1']	1
All I care about is power and money .	2	['2']	2

When have you had a date ?	1, 2, 7	['1', ' 2', ' 7']	1
You might hold this for me .	8	['8']	8
We'd roll it up and have snowball fights with it , you know ?	8, 2, 5	['8', ' 2', ' 5']	8
We're gonna get married .	2	['2']	2
Well , it figured . It was like that from the minute I laid eyes on her .	8, 5	['8', ' 5']	8
Goddamn , is that bitch on the rag or what ?	1	['1']	1
And don't mess with nobody's girlfriend .	8, 1	['8', ' 1']	8
And let me remind you , we lost two key PA's in one day .	1	['1']	1
They took [PERSON]'s body ? He can't even bury her ?	7	['7']	7
And these people in the union are smarter than what they used to be .	1, 3	['1', ' 3']	1
Well , it's our way of trying to understand .	8	['8']	8
Ooh ! Oh ! In the name of the holy father ,	5	['5']	5
Just find him .	3	['3']	3
While you two pricks are congratulating yourselves , you better realize maybe you put [PERSON]'s neck in it .	1, 4	['1', ' 4']	1
Get the fuck back !	1, 3, 4	['1', ' 3', ' 4']	1
Are you still mad about [LOCATION] ?	7	['7']	7
I suppose that she forgot or he did not think that it might die .	6	['6']	6
You're young and strangely sweet .	5	['5']	5
If you have a lawyer , it's a good time to call him .	8	['8']	8
Something's missing .	4	['4']	4
They ain't bad for waffles .	5	['5']	5
Here's what you're going to do . You're going to go back to [LOCATION] .	8	['8']	8
I have asked you here to meet the woman selected to represent the most discriminating publication in the world , Quality .	3	['3']	3
The Miss [PERSON] ? I don't believe it . My brother , [PERSON] , told me all about you .	7	['7']	7
There sure is gonna be some interesting people at that party .	2	['2']	2
I would like a water turtle , and this gentleman is interested in a dog .	8, 2	['8', ' 2']	8
I'm glad you said that .	5	['5']	5
They're in chaos .	4	['4']	4
Now , you stay put and listen to me .	1	['1']	1
If you wan na survive , you got ta slip the jab .	8	['8']	8
She's going to die if you don't help me .	4	['4']	4
Are you saying she was kidnapped ?	7	['7']	7
There's one on the back , but it's not the right one .	6	['6']	6
What do you mean you didn't see ?	1, 3	['1', ' 3']	1
But I can't volunteer anything .	4, 6, 7	['4', ' 6', ' 7']	4
You want to come inside ?	8	['8']	8
This is [PERSON] , Chief of Homicide Bureau Office of the District Attorney , County of [LOCATION] .	2	['2']	2
They said I was crazy , so they sent me to a mental hospital .	6	['6']	6
It's ... Not that big a deal .	8, 6	['8', ' 6']	8
Kuwaiti Star , we're moving into position to lower a diver onto your deck .	8	['8']	8
What'd he say ?	2	['2']	2
I thought it read like a cheap , dime - store novel .	3	['3']	3
I've got every man on it , but without FBI or locals , we're carrying a handicap .	4	['4']	4
This is good .	5	['5']	5
I think she's pretty .	5	['5']	5
I spent most of my life in institutions .	6	['6']	6
I'll make a special journey just to talk about myself .	2	['2']	2
But inevitably , there comes a time for waking up , even for us .	2	['2']	2
Why me ?	2, 4, 6, 7	['2', ' 4', ' 6', ' 7']	2
You'll find I'm pretty well - connected here .	8	['8']	8
I married [PERSON] because I was in love with him .	8, 5	['8', ' 5']	8
The Food Chain will purchase an apartment for you of your choice .	2	['2']	2
Sir !	8	['8']	8
You were winning ?	2, 7	['2', ' 7']	2
He's a prick .	1, 3	['1', ' 3']	1
He ain't gonna get my hide .	1	['1']	1
Well , will you talk to him about it , sometime ?	8	['8']	8

As am I . The black community deserves so much better than [PERSON]'s failed policies .	8, 1, 4	['8', ' 1', ' 4']	8
It takes away the pain .	6	['6']	6
I won't have this conversation carried on by the children .	1	['1']	1
My Xobile will do just fine , gentlemen .	8	['8']	8
I'll see you later , okay ?	5	['5']	5
No , Mr. [PERSON] , please don't call ...	4	['4']	4
I'll need help bathing and changing .	8	['8']	8
I don't know how I got home that night . The most difficult part was trying to ... act normal when I paid off the babysitter .	4, 7	['4', ' 7']	4
If not , get the fuck off my car !	1	['1']	1
That's part of the picture .	8	['8']	8
What are you gonna do there ?	7	['7']	7
Compliments of Capt. [PERSON] .	5	['5']	5
We already searched your apartment thoroughly .	1	['1']	1
And I stormed out .	1	['1']	1
Thank you for making me a Human Being .	8	['8']	8
Gentlemen , to Admiral [PERSON] .	2	['2']	2

I'll try , but she's in danger , [PERSON] .	4	['4']	4
Ha ha ha ! This is it , [LOCATION] ! The event you've all been waiting for .	1	['1']	1
For your information , I was at [LOCATION] .	1	['1']	1
Besides , whoever marries her will rule the entire kingdom .	8	['8']	8
We did it with the best intentions .	8	['8']	8
That's the fairest drink of whiskey you'll ever throw lip over , boy .	5	['5']	5
Sir [PERSON] , I presume ?	2, 5	['2', ' 5']	2
You're killing me .	6	['6']	6
And when that bill passed , I was so proud .	8, 2, 5	['8', ' 2', ' 5']	8
They notified me .	1, 7	['1', ' 7']	1
How did you find me ?	6, 7	['6', ' 7']	6
Now ! - Let me go !	1, 4	['1', ' 4']	1
I got it !	5	['5']	5
I told you I'd get those pearls tonight , didn't I ?	1	['1']	1
There . Have no fear , my son .	8	['8']	8
Whoa , look at that fish .	2	['2']	2
Does that sign say BQE ?	5	['5']	5
But now I know why I have always lost women to guys like you .	6	['6']	6
Hey , who turned out the lights ?	7	['7']	7
I think it was fun and sexy .	5	['5']	5
Don't be nostalgic .	1	['1']	1
You pull one thing , you're out .	1	['1']	1
The problem is , they already have a settlement .	4	['4']	4
This has been a long week , Dr. [PERSON] .	6	['6']	6
I won't go schizo , will I ?	4	['4']	4
We got the right ship .	8, 2, 5	['8', ' 2', ' 5']	8
I want to be a good dad .	5	['5']	5
You think that by saying ,  I'm sorry ,  all the past can be corrected .	6	['6']	6
That was a nice tribute to the guys .	5	['5']	5
There's nothing else I can do .	6	['6']	6
Please save us .	4	['4']	4
They've been infected with the bacteria .	3	['3']	3
You mean in the morning ?	7	['7']	7
It'll all be over by Thursday .	2	['2']	2
Yes , Rock .	5	['5']	5
It is time to fight .	1, 2	['1', ' 2']	1
That spark and fire I used to see in her eyes is gone .	6	['6']	6
Who you looking at ?	1	['1']	1
Glad you told me .	5	['5']	5
How did eggs get into the conversation ?	7	['7']	7
Erm ... I was just coming to that .	3	['3']	3
The solutions to [LOCATION]'s urgent and long - term potential problems are there .	2	['2']	2
You know , I'm not responsible for the complications of international law .	1	['1']	1
Do you celebrate tonight ?	2	['2']	2
Why don't you tell the truth for once ?	3	['3']	3
And now if ... When we get a cab we can complete the plan and live out our lives with a modicum of dignity .	8, 2, 5	['8', ' 2', ' 5']	8
Enter !	1	['1']	1
Open the door , asshole !	1	['1']	1
I mean , I realize you don't have to answer me , but don't forget I helped you into this world , okay ?	8, 4	['8', ' 4']	8
Something went wrong .	6	['6']	6
That's what friends are for .	8	['8']	8
A lady wouldn't work for this outfit .	1	['1']	1
He's been in uniform nine months but he's a good boy .	8	['8']	8
Oh , yes !	2, 5, 7	['2', ' 5', ' 7']	2
I got a friend bringing some dough .	8	['8']	8
These can be disposed of only by incapacitating the brain .	8, 4	['8', ' 4']	8
He's such a sweet thing .	8, 5	['8', ' 5']	8
Get the whole state moving !	2	['2']	2
He got kicked upstairs .	7	['7']	7
Anybody can type .	1	['1']	1
If that's true ... this should be very exciting .	2	['2']	2
Well , like I said , right now , I've got a bigger problem .	6	['6']	6
I decided to change all : our life , our home . I'll start here in [LOCATION] , in your so cold and dreary palace , ... With new furniture and paintings ,	2	['2']	2
They caught me on video and now they're threatening to press charges .	4	['4']	4
Well , I can tell you some stories .	2	['2']	2
The beers are in the refrigerator . Thank you .	2, 5	['2', ' 5']	2
Company's coming .	2	['2']	2
If I give you a raft of it now over the phone , can you print it up and spread a billion copies of it ?	8	['8']	8
Terribly disappointed . It's the last thing I owned .	6	['6']	6
And if he doesn't get it , he goes into bankruptcy and throws 900 , men out of work .	4	['4']	4
You put asses into seats .	1	['1']	1
Hey , [PERSON] . - What ? - You see the stars on the sidewalk ?	2	['2']	2
Cool , thank you .	7	['7']	7
It is he .	4	['4']	4
I'm going home . I - I'm not well .	4, 6	['4', ' 6']	4
Since he found out we're behind it , he's been running us ragged .	4	['4']	4
Your brother taught you to kiss ?	7	['7']	7
Damn [PERSON] , this is your last wish ?	7	['7']	7
Let it be anybody but her .	4	['4']	4
There's no reason for me to be here .	6	['6']	6
How did that happen ?	2, 7	['2', ' 7']	2
She wears the pants alright , but somehow she always strips her gears .	7	['7']	7
Thank you . - You're welcome .	5	['5']	5
Seven passengers and two crewmen were killed .	6	['6']	6
I never see anything happen .	6	['6']	6
Oh , sir , you forgot your map . And our million dollars .	1, 2, 7	['1', ' 2', ' 7']	1
That's out of our jurisdiction , isn't it ?	3	['3']	3
They must've wiped this place clean .	7	['7']	7
You must have a strong stomach to want to see that sort of thing .	7	['7']	7
Not so bad , but there's dirty weather ahead .	4	['4']	4
I'm just so scared .	4, 6	['4', ' 6']	4
Did the admiral want to see me about my beard ?	2	['2']	2
No , it's just ... I read in this thing that's what I'm supposed to do .	4, 7	['4', ' 7']	4
How about update tomorrow ?	2	['2']	2
We must be coming to the station .	2	['2']	2
Great day for it . You look glorious .	8, 2, 5	['8', ' 2', ' 5']	8
Okay , look , the last thing we knew , she was getting on that helicopter .	1, 7	['1', ' 7']	1
I said part of me  . 	1	['1']	1
Shoddy work will not do .	3	['3']	3
We're your family now , [PERSON] .	8	['8']	8
No , he has other things to do than spend his money on stupid things	3	['3']	3
How are we supposed to raise that kind of money ?	1, 2	['1', ' 2']	1
Did you not once direct [PERSON] and [PERSON] ?	2, 7	['2', ' 7']	2
I don't want to complain , but there's an institution called dinner .	1	['1']	1
His uncle helped to design the original lunar module that put the first men on the moon .	8	['8']	8
Well , I never said that .	1	['1']	1
I just feel like if I don't do what you want you're gonna leave me .	4	['4']	4
My grandma's really sick ,	4, 6	['4', ' 6']	4
We all have ideas of right and wrong . - - But we have to pitch in for the good of the family .	8, 2, 4	['8', ' 2', ' 4']	8

And you know how vain women are .	3	['3']	3
I know . Ring the alarm ?	4	['4']	4
Are you sure it's him ?	4, 7	['4', ' 7']	4
By heavens , an Englishwoman .	7	['7']	7
Might not get another chance .	6	['6']	6
Knock it off !	1	['1']	1
Not much comfort .	6	['6']	6
I thought we'd celebrate . Going to take us to dinner ?	2	['2']	2
Cheese doodles !	2	['2']	2
We'd be pleased if you would .	2, 5	['2', ' 5']	2
Darling , he'll never be able to support you .	4	['4']	4
Don't know if I'm ever gonna get my nails done now .	6	['6']	6
You see , fear is a fighter's best friend .	8, 2	['8', ' 2']	8
How they handle all this and ride a horse at the same time is beyond me .	7	['7']	7
The mess boys ate the strawberries .	1	['1']	1
Sometimes it's hard for us to understand the Lord's ways .	6	['6']	6
Even God wouldn't believe it !	7	['7']	7
You're working on your master's ?	2	['2']	2
My little finger , it's all black and blue .	4	['4']	4
Alright , knock it off !	1	['1']	1
You were terribly in love with her .	8, 5, 6	['8', ' 5', ' 6']	8
Whoa ! [PERSON] !	7	['7']	7
You don't get the truth in the Senate .	3	['3']	3
Go on , go to work .	1	['1']	1
I wish we did this before .	5	['5']	5
He spent money on a bible ?	7	['7']	7
The clerk will call the roll .	2	['2']	2
Come see me in the morning .	2	['2']	2
Essex , when will you realize how vital it is not to make enemies at court ?	3	['3']	3
I warn you , if this case comes to trial , it will be before a French court .	4	['4']	4
And they told me that you weren't that smart .	7	['7']	7
Don't you remember ?	7	['7']	7
You're in great danger .	4	['4']	4
We're the only ones who can afford to be honest .	1	['1']	1
This is one sophisticated operation .	8, 7	['8', ' 7']	8
Now where the hell am I ?	1, 4	['1', ' 4']	1
Has Mr. [PERSON] ever expressed to you ... Any reservations about [PERSON]'s abilities ?	2, 4	['2', ' 4']	2
I felt all warmed and funny inside . I can't describe it .	5, 7	['5', ' 7']	5
Send your cops home then .	1	['1']	1
So what's your problem ?	1	['1']	1
All right , so we got ourselves a real live rat , right ?	3	['3']	3
Not even a perhaps or a maybe ?	6, 7	['6', ' 7']	6
We're going to be killed !	4	['4']	4
A boy is dead and my son and husband are still out there .	4	['4']	4
Oh , I am sorry .	6	['6']	6
But and the Duchess ?	2, 7	['2', ' 7']	2
Have dinner with me .	8	['8']	8
I wish it were anybody's child but yours !	3	['3']	3
The door swings both ways , my ass .	1	['1']	1
That's darn cordial of you .	5, 7	['5', ' 7']	5
Ah , yes ! ' I had a migraine , your Majesty .	8, 6, 7	['8', ' 6', ' 7']	8
We need to warn [PERSON] and [PERSON] .	4	['4']	4
Well , [PERSON] was very insistent that I should give you a call .	2	['2']	2
It means , um ... if you say anything about this , - your ass is grass . - Okay .	1, 4	['1', ' 4']	1
I'm sure there is a very logical explanation for all this .	8	['8']	8
So alone .	6	['6']	6
Well , I hope you've managed to get the money , Mr. [PERSON] .	2	['2']	2
Really .	7	['7']	7
I promised myself when I get out of jail , I'm gonna find a Vago .	6	['6']	6
This is cool .	5	['5']	5
He likes to kick the shit out of white trash like you , boy .	3	['3']	3
I don't want to take up too much time .	2	['2']	2
Look , Doctor , this ain't [LOCATION] or [LOCATION] or wherever you come from .	3	['3']	3
Listen , I - I know you're gonna think this is real dumb of me , but , uh , I haven't been feeling very good lately , and , uh ...	2	['2']	2
Shoot it !	1, 2	['1', ' 2']	1
That's funny .	2, 5	['2', ' 5']	2
Let the fire fall !	5	['5']	5
That's normal . That's what she should be doing .	8, 5	['8', ' 5']	8
A legend on this force is dead .	6	['6']	6
I understand how you feel .	8	['8']	8
You're making me sick !	3	['3']	3
Well , too much TV is bad for my ears .	1, 3, 6	['1', ' 3', ' 6']	1
You'd still be my [PERSON] .	8	['8']	8
And time was running out fast .	4	['4']	4
He died kind of slow .	6	['6']	6
When a man gives a gift from the goodness of his heart like you gave me that butt , I remember it from the heart .	5	['5']	5
Some people never learn .	1	['1']	1
I'm my own master ... for the first time in my life .	5	['5']	5
Well , I reckon I'm in .	8	['8']	8
Just kind of go like this all the way around .	8	['8']	8
One particular night we just finished our refueling mission ,	2	['2']	2
She seems to be feeling a lot better .	5	['5']	5
They're coming to kill you !	4	['4']	4
No one can help me .	6	['6']	6
What happened ?	2, 4, 7	['2', ' 4', ' 7']	2
We are happy !	5	['5']	5
Then you did it alone !	1	['1']	1
You can't buy people's souls .	1, 3	['1', ' 3']	1
I don't wan na kill you , Bell .	6	['6']	6
What he could be is your son . Yeah , he's my seedling ' ...	7	['7']	7
Let me finish , sweet .	2	['2']	2
Do you wish me to translate [PERSON]'s letter or not ?	1	['1']	1
We have no choice .	3, 6	['3', ' 6']	3
I guess we're all trying to prove something to ourselves .	6	['6']	6
Okay , that didn't help at all .	6, 7	['6', ' 7']	6
We've been through this !	1	['1']	1
I think this is the greatest day I've ever spent .	5	['5']	5
[PERSON] , I'm in paradise .	5	['5']	5
[PERSON] , you're wonderful !	5	['5']	5
We'll keep her here , won't we ?	2	['2']	2
Our kids , struggling through their lives .	6	['6']	6
I can't let that happen again .	1, 3, 6	['1', ' 3', ' 6']	1
You run into him on the daisy chain you tell him I want to see him . Comprende ?	1	['1']	1
He stole them turnips .	3	['3']	3
Hi . Come on , dad , let's play ! Come on , dad , please , let's play .	2, 5, 6	['2', ' 5', ' 6']	2
How did you know about that ?	7	['7']	7
But until we figure it out , it may be a good idea for you to stay at home .	4	['4']	4
I hate my life .	6	['6']	6
You're breaking my fucking arm ! - Hurry !	1, 2, 4	['1', ' 2', ' 4']	1
We can talk about it tonight .	8, 5	['8', ' 5']	8
Oh , no ?	4, 7	['4', ' 7']	4
If you didn't try new things , there'd be no progress .	5, 7	['5', ' 7']	5
I'll see you inside .	2	['2']	2
It's loaded .	2	['2']	2
Christ .	1	['1']	1
It's wonderful to have you back .	5	['5']	5
You think I was born yesterday ?	1	['1']	1
You ain't gonna take no car .	1	['1']	1
In fact , we have so much evidence that Dr. J.[PERSON] [PERSON] , who was in charge of project Blue Book for the Air Force , stated that it's an embarrassment of riches .	1, 2, 3	['1', ' 2', ' 3']	1
We miss one payment , and you can foreclose ?	7	['7']	7
You got yourself a job .	8, 2	['8', ' 2']	8
Will you let me sleep ?	1	['1']	1
I can't save [PERSON] .	4	['4']	4
It's been over a week you've been gone .	7	['7']	7
You'll learn quick enough .	8	['8']	8
Who do you think you're punishing , huh ?	1	['1']	1
Since when is the disppearance of a human being considered trash , in your estimation , Ms Bantam ?	3	['3']	3
You're an operator , not a policymaker . Get used to it .	3	['3']	3
Well ... it ain't French , but ...	8, 4	['8', ' 4']	8
And if you were my friend , you'd do the same thing .	8, 2	['8', ' 2']	8
Every little sin and misdemeanour , raked over and over .	3	['3']	3
I just love it when it's so nice and warm .	5	['5']	5
Probably not .	1, 3	['1', ' 3']	1
I've kept it in my pocket for years .	8	['8']	8
The police have road blocks on every main exit from town .	4	['4']	4
One matters of saying to us , Mr. [PERSON] , where it was in the Monday afternoon , day of June ?	1, 2	['1', ' 2']	1
Don't lie to me , you pepper gut .	3	['3']	3
And it changes because the people at the top forget how they got there .	1, 3	['1', ' 3']	1
I can hear the fat lady singing , [PERSON] . I can hear her singing .	2	['2']	2
Now that you mention it ...	7	['7']	7
Nice meeting you . - Very nice meeting you . See you .	8, 5	['8', ' 5']	8
I know , [PERSON] , but ...	6, 7	['6', ' 7']	6
I had such a good time .	5	['5']	5
I was running out of things to say .	6	['6']	6
This girl appears from nowhere . Now she's talking to this guy . That's a little convenient , don't you think ?	4, 7	['4', ' 7']	4
Hey , hey , I'm off duty . Grand central station , please .	7	['7']	7
Not until I've made you laugh at least once .	2	['2']	2
Take my word for it , and don't try it .	8	['8']	8
Nail it up !	2	['2']	2
You mean , you could sell us but you won't ?	7	['7']	7
And so do you consider yourself human ?	2	['2']	2
I did it , bro .	8	['8']	8
I'm going right down .	2	['2']	2
There can be ...	2	['2']	2
All right , guys , what do you got ?	2	['2']	2
What about the horses and the cattle ?	7	['7']	7
Everybody just loves [PERSON] .	8, 5	['8', ' 5']	8
There's nothing I can do about it .	6	['6']	6
I know you will .	2	['2']	2
Maybe she has a sister .	2, 7	['2', ' 7']	2
I have to see the Childlike Empress .	2	['2']	2
A little further .	2, 5	['2', ' 5']	2
You're men !	1, 3, 4, 7	['1', ' 3', ' 4', ' 7']	1
Are you coming to the theater ?	2	['2']	2
Maybe we'll get lucky .	2, 5	['2', ' 5']	2
So be it . I will be the first corpse .	6	['6']	6
Close your mouth , dear .	1	['1']	1
Aren't you tired , [PERSON] ?	7	['7']	7
I am an expert on this .	8	['8']	8
I have information for you .	2	['2']	2
Or it's just [PERSON] that smells like street shit over there .	3	['3']	3
Where the hell are they ?	1	['1']	1
Would we have approved killing him in babyhood when he was innocent , or killing his mother , or slaughtering his remote ancestors ?	3	['3']	3
Their mandate , repeat , their mandate , is to lie , deny , and deceive .	1, 3, 7	['1', ' 3', ' 7']	1
I'm sorry . - No , that's all right .	8	['8']	8
Very well .	8	['8']	8
What the fuck ... !	1	['1']	1
Although I'm a duckling today , tomorrow I'm a swan	2	['2']	2
Life is more terrifying and more mysterious .	4	['4']	4
They have a craving for human flesh .	4	['4']	4
I could have finally gotten my yoga certification ... It wouldn't have been .	1, 6	['1', ' 6']	1
It is the monster !	4	['4']	4
Shit .	1, 6, 7	['1', ' 6', ' 7']	1
You mustn't cry anymore .	6	['6']	6
Sweetheart , don't get personal .	6	['6']	6
Either you come here to find out the mess , or we take your family .	1	['1']	1
Good luck , all right ?	8	['8']	8
Now try winning a game for a change !	1	['1']	1
My background is legal , not medical . My questions might be elementary .	6	['6']	6
Your little playmate's gone , and I suggest we do the same .	1	['1']	1
You mean to say I have this all to myself ?	7	['7']	7
Turk , don't make fun of me .	1	['1']	1
Summertime , all you can smell is the garbage .	3	['3']	3
You ought to see him dance .	5	['5']	5
Thought I saw some resemblance .	7	['7']	7
Is she the one in the painting ?	7	['7']	7
What am I gonna do ?	4, 6	['4', ' 6']	4
[PERSON] continued to invade your privacy .	1	['1']	1
I'm ashamed to put a picture of [PERSON] in a room like this .	3	['3']	3
If you have any last words , say them now .	1	['1']	1
We'd better go or we'll miss the movie .	2	['2']	2
Do you know what that means ?	2	['2']	2
Yeah , she was my girl .	6	['6']	6
Wet it with tears , bleed on it , [PERSON] .	1, 2	['1', ' 2']	1
We must protect these investments so the area can continue to prosper and grow .	8	['8']	8
I do , patrón .	8, 4	['8', ' 4']	8
Yeah . They're bleeding .	4	['4']	4
You see the moon out there ?	2	['2']	2
Use your influence , [PERSON] .	8	['8']	8
I saw an ad for a young lady that looked like she could have been or at least once a week .	6	['6']	6
You and [PERSON] make two nice goddesses .	5	['5']	5
The preparations for my departure ...	8, 6	['8', ' 6']	8
A desecration of what used to be the finest .	6, 7	['6', ' 7']	6
It's not negotiable , [PERSON] .	1	['1']	1
All right , you big bastard , come on .	3	['3']	3
It's not a matter I want to discuss , I tell you .	1	['1']	1
I'll see no one but [PERSON] as leader .	1	['1']	1
This is the bridal suite ?	7	['7']	7
That's a relief .	8, 5	['8', ' 5']	8
Then I lived in many European capitals , trying to forget something sad that happened long ago .	6	['6']	6
What are you looking at me like that for ?	1	['1']	1
I do not know what to do .	4	['4']	4
This is maybe the most important case that we handle in our legal career .	8, 2, 5, 7	['8', ' 2', ' 5', ' 7']	8
In two years time , he's gonna make a run for it .	8	['8']	8
Don't want any more of that .	1	['1']	1
Why don't you have another one ?	2	['2']	2
That is outrageous .	7	['7']	7
His life means nothing .	3, 6	['3', ' 6']	3
[PERSON] , it's getting late .	1	['1']	1
Hey , you're looking good .	5	['5']	5
Just hold it steady until I tell you .	8	['8']	8
Oh , hell !	1, 3, 4, 7	['1', ' 3', ' 4', ' 7']	1
Thought she wants to get an education .	7	['7']	7
Dad , they've got [PERSON] .	4, 6	['4', ' 6']	4
Sorry , [PERSON] , I didn't mean to scare you .	6	['6']	6
Oh , great news , I got some turkey burgers , you know we can grill , and watch a little Monday Night Raw tonight if you want ?	5	['5']	5
But for now , there is sufficient cowardice , sloth and mendacity down there on Earth to last forever .	3	['3']	3
I completely agree .	5	['5']	5
I was not jealous .	1	['1']	1
So , how hot are my girlfriend's new jeans ?	2, 5	['2', ' 5']	2
Isn't it marvellous ?	5	['5']	5
Collision speed ! Full !	4	['4']	4
Just do it .	8, 1, 2	['8', ' 1', ' 2']	8
You'd crawl over your dying mother to fuck your sister .	3	['3']	3
That sounds swell , [PERSON] .	5	['5']	5
Exaggerate .	1	['1']	1
Now , because I screwed up , read from that book , one lousy time , evil has found me .	4	['4']	4
Bad guy .	1, 6, 7	['1', ' 6', ' 7']	1
You'll see a puff of smoke from my exhaust when I cut in the motor . That's when you hit the magic button .	6	['6']	6
Outrageous !	1	['1']	1
I don't want to harm you .	6	['6']	6
You can't hide a corpse , [PERSON] .	1	['1']	1
Yes , but if we can't , we lose [LOCATION] .	8	['8']	8
Listen , my folks is important people in [LOCATION] .	1	['1']	1
There's no more running .	1, 5	['1', ' 5']	1
The guy was just talkin' about gettin' a shot .	4	['4']	4
Alright , here's how it works ....	2, 5	['2', ' 5']	2
Don't you stay up too late , OK ?	8, 5	['8', ' 5']	8
Sir , you have beaten my wife , and she has gone off with another man .	1	['1']	1
Hit him !	1	['1']	1
Cos I knew that if anybody could make me a winner , it was you .	8, 5	['8', ' 5']	8
[PERSON] , she tore the fuckin' place apart .	3	['3']	3
Dear God in Heaven , even these people can't be that mad .	4	['4']	4
Ain't gonna get tied down with no girl .	1, 2	['1', ' 2']	1
I guess that's why the old man gave it to you !	7	['7']	7
What beautiful roses .	5	['5']	5
Then why put up such a front ?	1	['1']	1
Hey , would you like a-a flabellina oculina ?	2	['2']	2
I need some protection now from [PERSON] .	4	['4']	4
What I say is , why go on living with them if they can't stand them ?	7	['7']	7
I wan na see what he's all about .	2	['2']	2
[PERSON] , I'm not an idiot and I don't appreciate being treated like one .	1	['1']	1
I don't think I want body - to - body contact .	3	['3']	3
You can't order me to do that .	1	['1']	1
You can't leave me with Ma !	1, 3	['1', ' 3']	1
Now it's yours .	8	['8']	8
Back in the village when they made fun of you , I wanted to kill them .	1	['1']	1
All you people don't know about lost causes .	3	['3']	3
I will make war on the world over , without mercy !	1	['1']	1
What happened ? Where are the others ?	7	['7']	7
So , I'm guessing you didn't find my dad .	6	['6']	6
You're a month early for the book fair .	7	['7']	7
You don't like jazz , pal ?	7	['7']	7
Hey , daddy's friends are here .	2	['2']	2
I never thought of that , sir .	7	['7']	7
[PERSON] , I am in danger .	4	['4']	4
Yet neither the husband or anybody else has been in to see her all day .	6	['6']	6
I thought you were supposed to eat fish on a Friday .	7	['7']	7
♪ Ooh , ooh , ooh ♪ ♪ There was Mermaid Minnie ♪	6	['6']	6
We'll make an honest buck together .	8	['8']	8
That makes no sense .	3	['3']	3
First time I ever kissed you .	8, 5	['8', ' 5']	8
You're invaluable , [PERSON] .	8	['8']	8
He was the sanest man I ever knew .	8	['8']	8
It was no self - defense , [PERSON] took him out .	1, 6, 7	['1', ' 6', ' 7']	1
You know , [PERSON] , I'm a little scared myself .	4	['4']	4
The loveliest lady I've ever seen .	5	['5']	5
Let him go !	1, 2	['1', ' 2']	1
It's great .	5	['5']	5
Guard them with your life .	8	['8']	8
I happen to be half - rag myself .	2	['2']	2
He's about to be boiled in oil .	1, 3, 4	['1', ' 3', ' 4']	1
My back's giving me hell .	6	['6']	6
I'm supposed to have some interesting dreams .	8, 2	['8', ' 2']	8
I absolutely do not wan na hear about it .	1	['1']	1
It's just all too much right now . You know , I just ...	1, 3	['1', ' 3']	1
No ! I don't know [PERSON] , I swear .	4	['4']	4
Now this is a fine thing .	5	['5']	5
It's not like you let me do anything anyway .	1, 6	['1', ' 6']	1
Let me be the first to welcome you to this afternoon's campaign banquet .	2	['2']	2
That's a terrible lot of money for a working woman to pay .	7	['7']	7
[PERSON] , that's a winner .	5	['5']	5
I'm not wearing pantyhose .	2	['2']	2
No , I don't need time ...	1, 6	['1', ' 6']	1
Don't worry , he'll be along .	8	['8']	8
You and [PERSON] are a couple of sluts .	3	['3']	3
I know you're trying to scare me , huh ?	2, 5	['2', ' 5']	2
You must have one idea for the good of the country .	3	['3']	3
We are doing our to protect the art .	2	['2']	2
You can get brave any time you feel like it .	5	['5']	5
You took away my czar , my country , my people .	1	['1']	1
We'll have to find new opportunities .	2	['2']	2
Don't panic .	8, 4	['8', ' 4']	8
Is this some sort of a gag ?	7	['7']	7
A place to belong .	8, 2, 5	['8', ' 2', ' 5']	8
I have to go to rehearsals .	2	['2']	2
It's [PERSON] ! [PERSON] from [LOCATION] .	2, 5, 7	['2', ' 5', ' 7']	2
They might take us for innocent bystanders .	4	['4']	4
This ain't your personal little war , you know .	1	['1']	1
They make me .	4	['4']	4
You're a credit risk .	3	['3']	3
Just some water , dude .	1	['1']	1
I'd like to speak to ...	2	['2']	2
That bridge would collapse under the first train .	4	['4']	4
They're warming up for it over at [LOCATION] .	2	['2']	2
I must have worn out your machine .	6	['6']	6
Tell everybody to go home .	1	['1']	1
These assholes have been after me for my sources and you're ...	3	['3']	3
Amazing .	5	['5']	5
I'm in a strange man surrounded by strangers in a strange room !	4	['4']	4
So , you're getting married ?	2	['2']	2
Even so , mon ami .	8, 2	['8', ' 2']	8
That's very good .	5	['5']	5
Take care of her , [PERSON] .	8	['8']	8
Jefe , wake up !	2	['2']	2
That kind of love isn't enough for two people as different as we are .	6	['6']	6
You're drunk .	3	['3']	3
Well , she simply said that you're a fat , pompous , bad - tempered old tyrant .	3	['3']	3
You chickenshit bastard .	3	['3']	3
Is not no one , who could take care of him ?	6	['6']	6
There's been enough bloodshed already .	6	['6']	6
Then you'll finally be rid of me .	2	['2']	2
[PERSON] , you of all people should understand by now that to me , they're the same thing .	3	['3']	3
How about that drink ?	2	['2']	2
We're going to raise towers of glass and steel .	2	['2']	2
Get off my back . I want to go home .	4, 6	['4', ' 6']	4
For a moment , I thought you were a man .	3	['3']	3
She is the most immoral young lady I have ever seen .	3	['3']	3
And we'll all be there for you .	8, 5	['8', ' 5']	8
It's so remote I thought I would ... be safe there . I figured no one could find me .	6	['6']	6
It made a thief of [PERSON] , a pig out of [PERSON] and a fool of you .	3	['3']	3
Oh , do you know , I love it this time of year with spring coming on .	5	['5']	5

The sun can kill some of us , like [PERSON] .	4	['4']	4

Apparently any mother , even a bad one , is better than none .	3	['3']	3
Fuck it , man .	1, 6	['1', ' 6']	1
The Navy has three psychiatrists who will testify that [PERSON] is sane .	8	['8']	8
Then , you know you've got a shitty witness .	1, 3	['1', ' 3']	1
The queue was endless .	6	['6']	6
I see 'em walking around the streets depressed all the time .	6	['6']	6
Well , there it is .	7	['7']	7
Well , this may not be the best time to bring it up , but a call just came in .	8, 4, 6	['8', ' 4', ' 6']	8
What's this big surprise you dragged me over here for ?	1, 2	['1', ' 2']	1

There was no more innocence anywhere .	8, 6	['8', ' 6']	8
Oh , please send her in .	1, 7	['1', ' 7']	1
They're quite merciless .	4	['4']	4
I triangulated her cell .	5	['5']	5
[PERSON] , I need to talk to you about a call that just came in .	4	['4']	4
Environmentalists call it a disaster .	1, 7	['1', ' 7']	1
Yes , well , she's a stupid woman .	3	['3']	3
Between the cousins and neighbors , there were kids , always causing trouble together .	1	['1']	1

We'll owe her .	2	['2']	2
I mean , we're a solid act , honey .	5	['5']	5

I care for you very much , Inglés .	8	['8']	8
What you fail to understand ... is the power of hate .	1, 2	['1', ' 2']	1
I was afraid of that .	4	['4']	4
You're the craziest old fool I guess I ever did see .	3	['3']	3
They expect me to cut my finger off .	3	['3']	3
You are a coward like all other people , aren't you ?	3	['3']	3
That's a foolish article of yours .	3	['3']	3
But you were never there for me , Dad .	6	['6']	6
When he finds out our dam is at his boys camp he'll start asking questions .	4	['4']	4

His words are too profound	5, 7	['5', ' 7']	5

Don't be a fool .	3	['3']	3
You're beautiful .	8, 5	['8', ' 5']	8

When we first went there , [PERSON] , he could barely speak .	6	['6']	6
Lovely woman . - Yes , I imagine what is .	5	['5']	5
Well , tell Mrs. [PERSON] to get to the bottom of it somehow .	1	['1']	1
Right now she has murder in her heart .	3	['3']	3
They're in [PERSON]'s pocket .	3	['3']	3
Do you have any idea when it'll be ready ?	2	['2']	2
So we eliminate women , old men and kids .	3	['3']	3
I spend time with them , yeah .	2, 5	['2', ' 5']	2
Why did the inspector allow me to say all those things ?	7	['7']	7
You ain't built for no fucking place like this !	1	['1']	1
I like [PERSON] .	5	['5']	5
You know what I'm asking .	1	['1']	1
Women just love single male parents .	7	['7']	7
I'd never leave you , Daddy .	8	['8']	8
You know , because you think of generals , and you think of Conservatives and Republicans as being very pro-military and business .	6, 7	['6', ' 7']	6
Roman ...	8	['8']	8
You're blacking out , waking up in places you don't remember , bleeding from where you were shot .	6	['6']	6
Look , I'm accused of doing something I didn't do .	1, 3	['1', ' 3']	1
Tomorrow we might be Xayide's prisoners .	2	['2']	2
Never talk about [PERSON] .	1	['1']	1
Come on , Lieutenant . What are the SEALs up to ?	1	['1']	1
Do you really want to know ?	7	['7']	7
You think I thought this was gonna happen ?	2, 7	['2', ' 7']	2
Hey , man , what'd you do this for ?	7	['7']	7

[PERSON] ? Put that gun down .	4	['4']	4
May I help you ? Miss Vale .	2	['2']	2
Good for you , [PERSON] .	5	['5']	5
If that horse would run tomorrow ,	2	['2']	2
Oh , what a delightful child .	5	['5']	5
It's all coming apart , Al.	4, 6	['4', ' 6']	4
That people would go and do that !	1, 3	['1', ' 3']	1
In the reprisal for the shelling of our homes and the murder of our families by American warships .	8, 4	['8', ' 4']	8
Or it might've just fallen overboard dropped there by some drunken old rummy .	3	['3']	3
For being the biggest dickhead I ever went out with .	3	['3']	3
There's no need for that .	1	['1']	1
His body and clothes soaked in blood ?	4	['4']	4
The pilots are up early for squadron exercises .	2	['2']	2
Not exactly .	6, 7	['6', ' 7']	6
What the hell is that ?	1, 3, 7	['1', ' 3', ' 7']	1
My god , I am still in love you .	2, 7	['2', ' 7']	2
I got offered a part in a movie .	5	['5']	5

What you got on me , Kid ?	1	['1']	1
She's gonna kill him , [PERSON] .	4	['4']	4
To be agreed upon price .	8	['8']	8
I suppose they were all in love with you .	5	['5']	5
They were looking at me .	4	['4']	4
He walks into the house without even knocking .	3	['3']	3
[PERSON] , don't worry . We'll come back the moment we find the boy .	8, 2	['8', ' 2']	8
But don't let them take the boots .	8, 1	['8', ' 1']	8
Now , today ...	2	['2']	2
It's over .	3, 4, 6	['3', ' 4', ' 6']	3
There's a train belonging to my government standing in [LOCATION] . There's a carriage for myself and my assistants .	8	['8']	8
He wouldn't tell us a goddamn thing .	1	['1']	1
I'll be stuck here doing your work while you run all over the city fighting crime or something .	3	['3']	3
I wouldn't have believed it .	7	['7']	7
Fucking A , sir .	5	['5']	5
We're going to celebrate .	2	['2']	2
With this rate of tariff , I'm confident it'll have a mitigating effect on the anti-dumping cases .	8	['8']	8
That explains why they didn't rape me right off .	4	['4']	4
I just hope there's no snakes round here .	4	['4']	4
Get on the roof !	4	['4']	4
The Delta [PERSON] house is having a party tonight , and you are cordially invited .	2	['2']	2
I'll bet he's gonna help us .	8	['8']	8
Hurry !	1, 2, 4, 7	['1', ' 2', ' 4', ' 7']	1
[PERSON] is not on trial .	1	['1']	1
I'm afraid so .	4	['4']	4
There he comes !	2, 5, 7	['2', ' 5', ' 7']	2
The worst would be a relief .	1, 6	['1', ' 6']	1
Did you want to see me ?	7	['7']	7
It's okay . It's okay .	5	['5']	5
I hope so , for your sake .	8	['8']	8
They think you can do it .	8	['8']	8
Cannonball !	5	['5']	5
She doesn't know .	6	['6']	6
If you insist , I'll have eight more .	2	['2']	2
You will not bleed .	8	['8']	8
Why would they change it now ?	7	['7']	7
[PERSON] .	8, 5, 7	['8', ' 5', ' 7']	8
My mama's gone to the Lord .	6	['6']	6
It's pleasant to see everything so prosperous with you here .	5	['5']	5
I'm also perfectly willing and able to cancel this entire production right now , and pay you off and write you off .	1	['1']	1
It doesn't have to be like this .	6	['6']	6
I thought it was the old man's	7	['7']	7
Well , I guess that's the good news .	8, 5	['8', ' 5']	8
Come on , you too !	2, 5	['2', ' 5']	2
One man muzzling a whole state ?	7	['7']	7
You people can either help me , or stay the hell out of my way .	1	['1']	1
Gentlemen , how about a little lunch ?	2	['2']	2
Are you looking for somebody ?	7	['7']	7
He's okay .	2, 5	['2', ' 5']	2
Did anyone else ?	2	['2']	2

So now they're best friends ?	2, 7	['2', ' 7']	2
I appreciate that , Agent [PERSON] .	8, 5	['8', ' 5']	8
But I can order with the best of 'em .	2	['2']	2
How did it go ?	2	['2']	2
Anyway , last year he comes to me . He wants some names checked out . Who was where , who's doing what .	2, 4, 7	['2', ' 4', ' 7']	2
Of course . Thank you .	5	['5']	5
Sorry , coach .	6	['6']	6
Can we talk ?	4, 6	['4', ' 6']	4
He is very talented .	5	['5']	5

I was in front and you were behind with a gun in my back .	4	['4']	4
And your love .	5	['5']	5
We're human beings , you know .	3	['3']	3
We've got to get the money in circulation before you'll get this country back to prosperity .	4	['4']	4
Get me out of here !	4	['4']	4
I'm not interested in what you think .	1	['1']	1

It's time to update the program and I would like to hear from each one of you .	2	['2']	2
Is there no a door of another side ?	4	['4']	4
Why aren't you chasing ambulances ?	7	['7']	7
Weren't you , in fact , intimate with the lady ?	1, 6	['1', ' 6']	1
He wants me to stay the whole week .	2	['2']	2
I can say no more .	6	['6']	6
I was frantic .	4	['4']	4
My kids can stay with me for as long as they would like .	5	['5']	5
Maybe they heard something .	4	['4']	4

I got ta hang up now because I got ta go kill everybody , okay ?	1, 3	['1', ' 3']	1

A wonderful idea .	5	['5']	5
But if [PERSON]'s an angel , why ain't he in Heaven ?	3, 4, 6, 7	['3', ' 4', ' 6', ' 7']	3
Except when you're throwin' up in the back of [PERSON]'s Chevelle .	3	['3']	3

My word , are there important people downstairs ?	7	['7']	7
You know , you have a worse mouth than my kid .	3	['3']	3
I got a hunch [PERSON] ain't got his mind on his business .	3	['3']	3
But you don't hear me complaining .	1	['1']	1
And loyal to you , ma'am .	8	['8']	8
What a good idea .	5	['5']	5

I won't . I promise . Goodbye , sweetheart .	8, 5	['8', ' 5']	8
Heh heh . Hear my words , demon . I will cast thee from this poor woman's soul ,	2	['2']	2

Because soon you'll be history . That's enough ! In the name of God ,	1	['1']	1
Let's just worry about getting out of here .	4	['4']	4

For three months , we've been listening to that sad sack spout his unhinged tirades , day in and day out , because we were promised % of the ransom .	3	['3']	3
It astonished me .	7	['7']	7

If you would've had four fours , you would've won .	6	['6']	6
Hey , come on , [PERSON] .	1	['1']	1
I won't let [PERSON] live like this .	1	['1']	1
I've been doing just that for years , until [PERSON] walked into my shop last week .	8, 4	['8', ' 4']	8
I'm sorry I can't wait here with you , but ...	6	['6']	6
But he became such a damn pest that I left [LOCATION] .	3	['3']	3
We don't commit murder up here .	3	['3']	3
You sit down and pull up your pants and where would it get you ?	3	['3']	3
If you ever want anything , anything at all , just ask for [PERSON] .	8, 2	['8', ' 2']	8
May I ask you a question ?	2	['2']	2

No , [PERSON] ! Don't !	4	['4']	4
This company of adults made the decision to post these pictures without even taking the time to find out if they were children .	1, 3	['1', ' 3']	1
There's no fucking handle !	1	['1']	1
But I'm expecting a courier any minute .	2	['2']	2

Could have used this a week ago .	1	['1']	1
It can be absolutely breathtaking .	5	['5']	5
I want you to applying for my son .	2	['2']	2
She knew something .	7	['7']	7
There'll be other dinners , [PERSON] .	2	['2']	2

His blood ?	4	['4']	4
I can hardly ever remember the audience being so excited .	5	['5']	5
What ? Thought I was gonna leave it to you ?	8	['8']	8
Damn it .	1	['1']	1
Impossible !	7	['7']	7
You can't come to my magic show .	1, 3	['1', ' 3']	1
You're out !	8, 1	['8', ' 1']	8
I loved your drawing .	5	['5']	5

It had to be total and it had to be honest .	8	['8']	8
That right , mister ?	1	['1']	1
We will now take an oath	8	['8']	8
Why don't you sit down and try not to waste my time ?	1	['1']	1
It's a matter of life and death .	4	['4']	4
It's a small part , but the producer said the next picture I'll have a bigger part .	2	['2']	2
But the man I'm in love with doesn't .	6	['6']	6
Nice guy , I hope .	2	['2']	2
So , we got rogue individual or complete institutional failure ?	1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8	['1', ' 2', ' 3', ' 4', ' 6', ' 7', ' 8']	1
I was astonished at the extent of his reputation .	2, 4, 5, 7	['2', ' 4', ' 5', ' 7']	2
But I was crying because I. ...	6	['6']	6
Where are these kind souls that are supposed to help us ?	2, 6	['2', ' 6']	2
Get off me !	1, 4	['1', ' 4']	1
Okay , it was just a thought .	6	['6']	6
Sir , is human life at stake ?	4	['4']	4
Looking at the moon and feeling lonely	5, 6	['5', ' 6']	5
I'm anxious to get back to the office .	2	['2']	2
Tell the King ... that try to forgive him .	2, 5	['2', ' 5']	2
No more .	6	['6']	6
Let me in ! Let me in !	7	['7']	7
What do you mean ?	2, 4, 7	['2', ' 4', ' 7']	2
Can you imagine her traveling around the world with a camera bum who never has more than a week's salary in the bank ?	3	['3']	3
How much further into the rectory are you going to push it ?	1	['1']	1
I'm shaky .	4, 6	['4', ' 6']	4
I don't know about that .	4	['4']	4
Thanks for telling me .	8	['8']	8
You've come home .	7	['7']	7
Without you , [PERSON] .	6	['6']	6
You're all I ever had .	6	['6']	6
And you're gonna have to blow me up too !	1	['1']	1
I'm an old man who will live until I die .	6	['6']	6
Qualified ?	7	['7']	7
I did my best and I was very ably assisted by my colleagues .	8	['8']	8
Therefore , I'll always get laid more than you , which is fundamentally unjust , am I right ?	8, 5	['8', ' 5']	8
For God's sakes , be careful out there !	4	['4']	4
We're prisoners of war .	4	['4']	4
Tell him it's none of his business .	1	['1']	1
What is important about that action is that it was a number of Fortune companies telling that business , that they believe there is illegal conduct happening and they weren't gonna support it .	1, 3	['1', ' 3']	1
Yet somehow I felt within myself a new source of power .	5	['5']	5
Maybe if I stuck him in a giant anthill , that would loosen his tongue and then ...	1	['1']	1
Did you like Captain [PERSON] ?	2	['2']	2
It tried to kill my Raymond !	4	['4']	4
These little rascals make life worth living .	8, 5	['8', ' 5']	8
You know , for a minute , that [PERSON] almost had me convinced I was wrong .	7	['7']	7
What a place to be stuck .	4, 7	['4', ' 7']	4
You're supposed to say something .	4, 6	['4', ' 6']	4
We're partnering on a project .	8	['8']	8
Yeah , all right , you got a lot goin' .	6	['6']	6
Splendid , thank you , sir .	5	['5']	5
Why won't you let me help you ?	6	['6']	6
And actresses are treated like I hate to use the word , but , shit .	1, 3, 4, 6	['1', ' 3', ' 4', ' 6']	1
Why don't you just go ?	6, 7	['6', ' 7']	6
Help , I'm slipping !	4	['4']	4
First , I would like to take off my hat .	2	['2']	2
It's a deal .	8	['8']	8
I got plenty I can do on my own in [LOCATION] !	2	['2']	2
If he made it , so can I !	5	['5']	5
Oh , no !	4, 6	['4', ' 6']	4
Yeah , I dreamt about trains .	5	['5']	5
Hey , quit moving in there !	1	['1']	1
Until a trial ... When she sees her husband suffer ... The way she never ...	3, 6	['3', ' 6']	3
Yes . You know the nun you spoke to last night ?	2	['2']	2
Ring the alarm !	4	['4']	4
It's about time .	1	['1']	1
It's impossible to make a real dent . But it is possible to hurt individual assholes who fuck it up for everyone .	1	['1']	1
Bad guys ! Alley !	2, 7	['2', ' 7']	2
Because it's on his way . Bye girlfriend !	2	['2']	2
Such personal questions are not appropriate .	1, 3	['1', ' 3']	1
I mean , we're talking about one day of work . A day in which I was tied to a cactus and assaulted by snakes .	1	['1']	1
Because I always get lucky .	5	['5']	5
But you shouldn't open other people's letters .  	1	['1']	1
I got ta get back . Move it back !	4	['4']	4
Mr. [PERSON] ? You all right ?	7	['7']	7
Are you willing to take that chance ?	2	['2']	2
If we keep our stern to the wind , we'll roll over .	4	['4']	4
I know exactly where I am .	3	['3']	3
Who is this woman ?	7	['7']	7
You big pussy !	1, 3	['1', ' 3']	1
Left !	1	['1']	1
Shut up , [PERSON] !	1	['1']	1
At the moment , you have an excellent chance of being hanged .	7	['7']	7
Daddy . You want to name her daddy ?	3, 7	['3', ' 7']	3
Thank you . I am still curious	5, 7	['5', ' 7']	5
I am also concerned about the misinformation about nuclear waste .	4	['4']	4
You win this race , and you'll get three years ' pay .	8	['8']	8
It's our new swimming pool !	5	['5']	5
You'll make no calls .	1	['1']	1
I knew there'd be a catch to this .	6, 7	['6', ' 7']	6
Besides , I really do repent . Really .	3	['3']	3
Only those I trust know that .	8	['8']	8
He should have been here by now .	4	['4']	4
Maybe a house in [LOCATION] where they are rich .	2	['2']	2
Let's go , gentlemen .	2	['2']	2
Put them back .	1	['1']	1
That's how it works .	1, 2, 5	['1', ' 2', ' 5']	1
I was never really sure which one I got , nutrition or discipline .	6	['6']	6
The world was too ridiculous even to bother to live in it .	6	['6']	6
I want to get away from you cops and wops and junkies .	1, 3	['1', ' 3']	1
How the hell do you know where we are ?	1, 7	['1', ' 7']	1
[PERSON] will never stand for it .	6	['6']	6
Barney , I am sorry .	6	['6']	6
Every dog I ever knew seemed to have a very nice life indeed .	5	['5']	5
It's a CIT ?	7	['7']	7
I was very sick when I was a boy .	6	['6']	6
These are businessmen with no knowledge of creative personalities .	3	['3']	3
You see that gun in his hands ?	4	['4']	4
Unfortunately , Murder Incorporated beats a path to their door first .	2	['2']	2
Be careful !	4	['4']	4
Not covet thy neighbor's wife .	4	['4']	4
Let's forget it .	8, 1	['8', ' 1']	8
I hope I never get old and have to be in a wheelchair and have to depend on the ushers to help me out of church .	6	['6']	6
Look , don't blame us because the warship shelled you .	1	['1']	1
OK , thank you , everyone . That's all .	2, 5	['2', ' 5']	2
I don't know what I did to piss this guy off , but he decides he's gonna kill me .	1, 2	['1', ' 2']	1
How are you guys ?	1	['1']	1
Is that all ?	2	['2']	2
Be a good fellow and get out now .	1	['1']	1
It's good to see home folks .	5	['5']	5
The fish that got away is always the biggest one .	6	['6']	6
We have lots of little problems like this .	3	['3']	3
I can tell you now I was a little worried when I heard you weren't going to be here yourself .	4	['4']	4
It is absurd !	3	['3']	3
Did I hear somebody call for their old man ?	7	['7']	7
Is he well ?	2	['2']	2
I demand you stop this car !	1, 4	['1', ' 4']	1
Come on !	1, 2, 4, 5, 7, 8	['1', ' 2', ' 4', ' 5', ' 7', ' 8']	1

Wait a minute now .	7	['7']	7
Well , might as well make myself useful .	8, 3, 4	['8', ' 3', ' 4']	8
I'm peeing my pants .	3, 4, 6	['3', ' 4', ' 6']	3
I'm in an awful hurry .	4	['4']	4
The dopes are going to inherit the earth anyway .	3	['3']	3
You've made me a very happy old man .	8, 5	['8', ' 5']	8
There's a man down there on his head .	4	['4']	4
I can't sleep .	6	['6']	6
First of all , I'd like to thank everyone who supported me in my race for Mayor .	5	['5']	5
Let me finish . Of course nobody will buy it if they know it's rat .	1	['1']	1
I've got to go to [LOCATION] , first plane .	6	['6']	6
♪ The colors of the rainbow ♪	5	['5']	5
Are you vulnerable to him in any way ?	3, 4	['3', ' 4']	3
You damn fool ! I told you to get off this case !	1	['1']	1
That's all I need , five more minutes .	4, 6	['4', ' 6']	4
There's no change in it , is there ?	1, 7	['1', ' 7']	1
Looks like trouble ahead .	4	['4']	4
I know so .	8	['8']	8
I'm so clumsy . I'm sorry .	3, 6	['3', ' 6']	3
I'll drive you somewhere in the car .	2	['2']	2
Are you feeling well , [PERSON] ?	8	['8']	8
Get these men out of here .	1	['1']	1

Okay , girls , go get them !	2	['2']	2
In case I want to read it more than once .	2, 5	['2', ' 5']	2
Hello !	2, 5	['2', ' 5']	2
If the city can pay , we'll be humiliated .	2, 4, 6	['2', ' 4', ' 6']	2
[PERSON] wrote something awful nice .	5	['5']	5
I do not know what you are , but you are not a woman .	3	['3']	3
We're lucky not to be home during the bad weather , aren't we ?	5	['5']	5
And I could get you your own key .	8	['8']	8
This is a whole new world to me .	2	['2']	2
Tell the governor I won't wait any longer .	2	['2']	2
I'll win something .	2	['2']	2
Here they come !	2	['2']	2
And in a fit of anger , I told her that our being together , our rekindled romance , was a big mistake .	6	['6']	6
Case is here !	5, 7	['5', ' 7']	5
Oh , pardon me ... Your reverend and holy slime ball .	3	['3']	3
Harry , you got a nice shop here .	5	['5']	5
Just shut up about her , all right ?	1, 3	['1', ' 3']	1
Are you blind ?	1	['1']	1

Lousy bank robber , too .	3	['3']	3
Don't push me too far , [PERSON] .	1	['1']	1
You're alive !	5	['5']	5
Of course you're not crazy .	8	['8']	8
I don't want to hear another word .	1	['1']	1
I also think we'll know very soon who it is .	2	['2']	2
How very nice of you to say .	5	['5']	5
I'm not opening that door and neither are you , and if you try ...	4	['4']	4
You mean you're through with the case ?	7	['7']	7
And she got in a car accident .	6	['6']	6
Don't worry , we won't take the brief , but an old friend needs help .	8	['8']	8
I've slaved in that man's factory for years and years .	6	['6']	6
Don't embarrass me in front of [PERSON] .	4	['4']	4
Some days I wake up --	4, 6	['4', ' 6']	4
But with a nice sort of craziness .	5	['5']	5
At , she was so pretty .	5, 7	['5', ' 7']	5
For what ?	1	['1']	1
As in ... pointless .	1, 3, 4	['1', ' 3', ' 4']	1
It's gonna be a massacre .	4	['4']	4
They haven't even been touched !	7	['7']	7
Who said I'm moving ?	7	['7']	7
I - I am working on it , and I will figure it out .	4	['4']	4
Really ashamed of myself .	6	['6']	6
You're fucking right .	1, 2	['1', ' 2']	1
What are you doin' here ?	7	['7']	7
We have so much .	8, 5	['8', ' 5']	8
I've already seen a doctor .	1	['1']	1
I mean % of the [LOCATION] population have seen these objects , but you create an environment where the subject is so pilloried and ridiculed , that no respectable scientist or doctor would want to be identified with it .	1, 3, 4	['1', ' 3', ' 4']	1
Why don't you back the hell off of her ?	1	['1']	1
There's no room in sports for people like you .	3	['3']	3
Six days of this and I'll make you a hero .	8	['8']	8
She's a friend .	8	['8']	8
Oh , no ! - Oh , yes !	7	['7']	7
The X-rays will be along shortly .	8, 2	['8', ' 2']	8
I'm actually beginning to like them .	7	['7']	7
I don't like your faces .	1	['1']	1
I knew we'd be all right .	5	['5']	5
I'll kill him and his bloody beast .	1	['1']	1
I can hear it ring from the boat . Let it ring a Iong time .	2, 5	['2', ' 5']	2
You can't see him because you're not dead yet .	1	['1']	1
Yo , [PERSON] !	2, 5, 7	['2', ' 5', ' 7']	2
Do not be afraid .	8, 2	['8', ' 2']	8
I just ... I like him .	8, 5	['8', ' 5']	8
Midship damage control won't answer .	4	['4']	4
Take your hands off there , you old fool .	3	['3']	3
Let's open the wine now .	2	['2']	2
I'm not coming .	3	['3']	3
Tell her about our special student housing program .	2	['2']	2
Oh , know how to count !	1, 7	['1', ' 7']	1
Let me borrow that pen again .	1, 2	['1', ' 2']	1
Give me the money .	1, 2	['1', ' 2']	1
[PERSON] , what's happenin' here ?	7	['7']	7
And there's this great Cézanne coming up for sale in a very messy divorce .	2	['2']	2
You're gonna get my babies killed !	1, 3, 4	['1', ' 3', ' 4']	1
We'll have a little surprise for you tonight .	2	['2']	2
Stop . Stop .	4	['4']	4

I'm a little tense about the exam tomorrow .	2, 4	['2', ' 4']	2
They ain't gonna quit on me .  	8	['8']	8
Get in .	3	['3']	3
How can you ask me that now ? I'm sorry .	3	['3']	3
I have a politician who's unable to make a decision .	1	['1']	1
The old man can still catch , huh ?	7	['7']	7
A cockroach !	3	['3']	3
Thank you for stopping , you saved my life !	8, 5	['8', ' 5']	8
No , we're not done but you are .	1	['1']	1
If [PERSON] was drugged , do you believe what he's saying ?	2, 4, 6, 7	['2', ' 4', ' 6', ' 7']	2
I love [LOCATION] .	5	['5']	5
We're going to lose a man like [PERSON] here for that ?	3, 6	['3', ' 6']	3
If I can watch TV .	1	['1']	1
The sun's still high , you can try it again .	5	['5']	5
I hate this place .	1, 3, 4	['1', ' 3', ' 4']	1
Do I look like a baroness ?	7	['7']	7
Look , I was a bit of an asshole .	6	['6']	6
I'm afraid Scraps will have to be shot .	6	['6']	6
I've had a hell of a time after I've told this story , but I continue to tell the story because I think it's important for people to understand that this sort of shit goes on in the government !	1, 2, 4	['1', ' 2', ' 4']	1
Um , I found someone else to -- to take your room ,	3	['3']	3
I was so miserable at the thought of you in trouble .	6	['6']	6
Mr. [PERSON] , do you think really that I could be a star ?	7	['7']	7
You have been my friend and patron .	8	['8']	8
Why don't you  try it ? 	1	['1']	1
My magical powers are no good at all	6	['6']	6
They saw something they weren't supposed to see .	1, 6	['1', ' 6']	1
This thing isn't here for decoration .	1	['1']	1
Wow ... you look great .	8, 5, 7	['8', ' 5', ' 7']	8

Men flirt with girls like that , but they don't marry them .	1	['1']	1
You can say that again .	8, 1	['8', ' 1']	8

She seemed too restless , too tense , too withdrawn , and [PERSON] , when he wasn't looking at [PERSON] , he was watching [LOCATION] look at Maria .	6	['6']	6

I'm dizzy , I'm gonna faint .	4	['4']	4
I - I know , I know .	1	['1']	1
I guess I can't blame you .	6	['6']	6
Then , one night , we were talking about how we hated the life , and how we had never done much of anything ourselves .	6	['6']	6
Yeah , I'm just waiting for the taxi .	2	['2']	2
That's very rude , refusing to dance with [PERSON] .	3	['3']	3

He objects , she sustains , every time . The old flame's still burning , huh ?	7	['7']	7
Haven't I told you you're gonna get your melon opened ?	4, 5	['4', ' 5']	4

More importantly , what the hell am I doing here ?	1, 3	['1', ' 3']	1
Hey , you're very light on your feet .	5	['5']	5
Sometimes cheap perfume can be very exciting .	5	['5']	5
I wanted to surprise you .	2	['2']	2
If you were a man , I'd break your neck for that .	1	['1']	1
Mr [PERSON] , I was wondering when you'd let me have your blue car .	2	['2']	2
Get down ! I said now , asshole !	1	['1']	1

And did you believe this nonsense ?	7	['7']	7
[PERSON] were coming out of his nose .	3	['3']	3

You don't know him like I do .	1	['1']	1
Let's get out of here !	4	['4']	4
I don't like the way you're treating [PERSON] and Mammy .	3	['3']	3
What's the matter , dear ?	4	['4']	4
I want them to tell [PERSON] that [PERSON] is dirty .	2	['2']	2
Oh , okay .	8, 4	['8', ' 4']	8
That's why audiences love me .	5	['5']	5
We ... we have a few more questions to ask .	4	['4']	4
No one's ever gotten away with a stunt like this before .	7	['7']	7
Earth , open up !	2	['2']	2
Got all the time in the world .	5	['5']	5
It was just so perfect I just had to catch it .	5	['5']	5
We got 'em !	2, 5, 7	['2', ' 5', ' 7']	2
And every single one of those memories that you're so desperate to pry out of his damaged brain can turn him right back into it .	3, 4, 6	['3', ' 4', ' 6']	3
After months of combat , it takes hours a day to keep her together .	8, 5, 6	['8', ' 5', ' 6']	8
You're perfectly right .	8	['8']	8
I hadn't heard you'd sold the place .	7	['7']	7
Gather around , me buckoes , and feast your eyes on this .	2	['2']	2
Honey , if you change your mind , just let me know .	8	['8']	8

Darling , is that you ?	2	['2']	2
Father mayii ! Where are you ?	4	['4']	4
You know this guy !	1	['1']	1
From then on I was hopelessly lost .	6	['6']	6
Let's go to St.[LOCATION] .	2	['2']	2
How soon can we have this on the market ?	2	['2']	2
Forget it !	1	['1']	1
Let's see !	2	['2']	2
Rather like a picnic , isn't it ?	5	['5']	5
You don't see what's happening .	1	['1']	1
Did I hear Lieutenant Junior Grade  ? 	1, 7	['1', ' 7']	1
I can try .	2	['2']	2
In the dream , the destroyer's destroyed .	4	['4']	4
I got a wife and a family I'm not with , [PERSON] ,	6	['6']	6
[PERSON] , I'd like to hear it speak .	2	['2']	2
We got to find [PERSON] .	8, 2	['8', ' 2']	8
I rehearse my story . I try to think of all the questions they'll ask .	7	['7']	7
All right , you rat prick .	3	['3']	3
Imagine this place on that day when the battleship [LOCATION]  fired that blank shot which signalled the Revolution . 	2	['2']	2
Who's the dame ?	2	['2']	2
Look at that !	5	['5']	5
I got a goddamn campaign to win .	1	['1']	1
We have to watch these convicts and murderers all the time .	3	['3']	3
Sounds great . I don't think she's taking us that seriously .	5	['5']	5
Better make it tomorrow .	2	['2']	2
[PERSON] , what's going on ?	1	['1']	1
Do you want to know everything ?	6	['6']	6
How did you enjoy the ride ?	5	['5']	5
What do you know about this ?	1	['1']	1
[PERSON] , thanks ever so much .	8	['8']	8
Robbers , plural ?	8	['8']	8
So if you're bad often enough , you'll die .	3	['3']	3
I enjoy to live .	5	['5']	5
Get going , [PERSON] ! [PERSON] !	1	['1']	1
It may bring you serious trouble .	4	['4']	4
Asses burnt to a cinder .	4	['4']	4
Dear , a mere child .	3, 4	['3', ' 4']	3
Sign it !	2	['2']	2
Oh , kids , I'm so sorry !	6	['6']	6
I would like you to meet a few of the exhibits here on the platform .	2	['2']	2
How do you know all that ?	7	['7']	7
It still has the keys , Mr. [PERSON] ? - Oui .	2, 7	['2', ' 7']	2
Admiral's party approaching .	3	['3']	3
This is where the fun starts .	8, 2, 5	['8', ' 2', ' 5']	8
My headache's much worse .	6	['6']	6
Look !	5, 7	['5', ' 7']	5
That high is not the one you're looking for . Believe me .	3, 6	['3', ' 6']	3
You gonna cry , [PERSON] ?	6	['6']	6
The government's got enough on its hands already without ...	3	['3']	3
Are they all shark victims ?	4	['4']	4
We've heard such wonderful things about you .	5	['5']	5
We're not interested in him .	3	['3']	3
Help us .	8, 4, 5	['8', ' 4', ' 5']	8
Satan , stop !	1	['1']	1
Stay with me .	4, 6	['4', ' 6']	4
Help me ...	8, 4, 6	['8', ' 4', ' 6']	8
I don't say that with any kind of blame or accusation , but that is when it started .	6	['6']	6
Simply no use trying .	6	['6']	6
Has decided to demolish ...	6	['6']	6
The spirit world , man .	8, 2	['8', ' 2']	8
I'm as good as [PERSON] ever was and I'm tired of being called a damn robot !	1	['1']	1
She's on her way . - Fine .	1	['1']	1
Just a moment .	2	['2']	2
Right now . - Right now ? - ( chuckles )	2, 5, 7	['2', ' 5', ' 7']	2
I'm sorry , gentlemen ...	6	['6']	6
Running around in that eye paint ain't gonna get you nowhere , boy .	1, 6, 7	['1', ' 6', ' 7']	1
Like a velvet glove cast in iron , and like the gas chamber , [PERSON] , a real fun gal .	1, 3	['1', ' 3']	1
You reject it .	6	['6']	6
Darling , your present just arrived .	2	['2']	2
Here's the , uh , camera , And the cassette recorder that you asked for . Thank you .	5	['5']	5
I've told you that a dozen times .	1	['1']	1
Maybe going on the wagon makes a man dull .	3	['3']	3
No way [PERSON] is going to talk me into cutting celery again .	1	['1']	1
Oh , you little beauty !	5	['5']	5
[PERSON] , you're going too fast .	1	['1']	1
She's vulnerable , wide - open to be hurt badly .	4, 6	['4', ' 6']	4
Look , [PERSON] , I - I've known all along That you were stealing food and treasure .	6	['6']	6
Yeah , I got you .	8	['8']	8
I like street cats .	5	['5']	5
Then come the physical proofs :	2	['2']	2
That's my girl .	8, 5	['8', ' 5']	8
l knew you were gonna say that .	5	['5']	5
An immense reservoir of nature , Where I roam at will .	5	['5']	5
Who cares where he's going anyway ?	1	['1']	1
They'd go to Congress and get more funding .	6	['6']	6
What's Zharkov doing on the plane ?	7	['7']	7
But my shirt is wet .	1	['1']	1
He's doing fine .	5	['5']	5
I'll do a better job . You're so out of it , you'd botch that up .	1, 6	['1', ' 6']	1
What happens to us now ?	4	['4']	4
Honey , you comin' to bed ?	8	['8']	8
How you doing ?	8, 2, 5	['8', ' 2', ' 5']	8
What that child got to stand , the good Lord give her strength to stand .	6	['6']	6
Your refusal to speak to me is tediously immature , [PERSON] .	3	['3']	3
Otherwise , I fear not only for the safety of our men , but frankly , for their lives as well .	4	['4']	4
Go ahead .	8, 2	['8', ' 2']	8
[PERSON] , through you , we have learned that they seek plunder , not justice .	8	['8']	8
Listen , I got a favour to ask ya .	8	['8']	8
Then you ought to understand why I can't .	8	['8']	8
That's not for you to say .	1	['1']	1
Can I just have a second before we start ?	8	['8']	8
You look terrific .	5	['5']	5
Now , if you don't , then I will suspend you .	1, 2	['1', ' 2']	1
Oh , there ! Now , I'll just look perfect when I sing my song !	5	['5']	5
You're the first good thing that's happened to us .	5	['5']	5
Just like I belong as a priest . And your mother and your husband too .	8	['8']	8
He promised to pursue it vigorously .	4	['4']	4
This life is not only wicked and sinful .	3	['3']	3
What's his name again ?	7	['7']	7
But , sir , when the job's done , who knows if we can return by this route or whether we could find you if we did ?	4	['4']	4
You'll be called vice president , but you will be , de facto , something more .	8	['8']	8
You made an oath to obey the law .	2	['2']	2
Your son is sleeping there .	1	['1']	1
[PERSON] ' your life for that little fucker !	3	['3']	3
You won't take my check . I'll say .	1	['1']	1
Back the starboard engine !	7	['7']	7
It's awfully quaint , isn't it ?	4	['4']	4
[PERSON] was producing a motion picture , his first .	2	['2']	2
If this guy has any information , why hasn't he contacted you already ?	3, 7	['3', ' 7']	3
Darling , tell me , when are you to announce the exciting news about [PERSON] ?	2	['2']	2
Do you girls mind if we run some timing trials ?	2	['2']	2
He tries to prove he's a real man and he's not .	3	['3']	3
You didn't come to my wedding .	6	['6']	6
If there was a bum within miles , I was completely attracted to him .	3, 5, 6	['3', ' 5', ' 6']	3
Imagine being forced to build that in the condition they must be in .	4	['4']	4
I wan na do you .	8, 2, 5	['8', ' 2', ' 5']	8
I mean , you and I , right now , this weekend , we're here at this camp selling ourselves .	1	['1']	1
We should both go .	4	['4']	4
Get it through your head , or you and me are both gone too .	4	['4']	4
You naughty boys .	1, 3	['1', ' 3']	1
But you have such an honest face .	8	['8']	8
Come out , come out wherever you are ...	4	['4']	4
Remote and useful .	8	['8']	8
In fact , I'm just about to haul nuggies .	5	['5']	5
An ordinary vessel would've suffered heavy damage .	5	['5']	5
I'll get you now !	4	['4']	4
Bastard .	1	['1']	1
Do you want to be a truck driver again ?	1	['1']	1
Do you remember what sins ?	2	['2']	2
I don't make deals with peasants !	3	['3']	3
Look , friend , I already told you , you don't know me .	1	['1']	1
It's for you , the famous [PERSON] .	8, 2, 5	['8', ' 2', ' 5']	8
He was my first lover .	8, 5	['8', ' 5']	8
Cops are on strike , stupid .	1	['1']	1
We'll have to hope that that's enough .	4	['4']	4
It works ! I'm cured !	5, 7	['5', ' 7']	5
( giggles ) oh , you don't .	8, 5	['8', ' 5']	8
Walk like a man , for God's sake !	3	['3']	3
Sometimes the captain of a ship needs help ... constructive loyalty .	8	['8']	8
One , that I don't mess up as a manager .	4	['4']	4
Oh , it's still there .	7	['7']	7
Get your hands off him or I'll call the Metropolitan scuffers !	1	['1']	1
But I don't give up so easily .	1	['1']	1
I think I love you .	8, 2, 5	['8', ' 2', ' 5']	8
He doesn't have your heart .	8	['8']	8
A boy that I watched grow up was in that car that you threw the hornets into .	3	['3']	3
They told me you had a wine cellar , but I didn't believe it .	7	['7']	7
I thought you might be interested .	2	['2']	2
UFOs are as real as the planes flying over your head .	8	['8']	8
And you found out ?	7	['7']	7
I hope to see more of you , when you're free of the spell of Mr. [PERSON] .	2	['2']	2
There'll be a slight delay .	1	['1']	1
He asked her to marry him after the war .	8, 5	['8', ' 5']	8
Did I spend 9 , years with matadors not to learn about fear and safety ?	1	['1']	1
This is dreadful !	6	['6']	6
Hey , what kind of news are you leaving me there ?	2	['2']	2
People out there are looting the streets , robbing off hard earners , hard grafters .	3	['3']	3
Don't shoot !	4	['4']	4
Bad for you , worse for me .	6	['6']	6
We're not one - issue voters .	8	['8']	8
Well , it's , very kind of you ...	3	['3']	3
In a few months , I will become a citizen .	2	['2']	2
But , I , after spending years I found not a shred of evidence that we have alien visitors in our skies .	3	['3']	3
You're welcome to join me .	2	['2']	2
You look a little off - colour , [PERSON] .	4	['4']	4
knots through the harbour ?	7	['7']	7
You're not beginning that again , are you ?	7	['7']	7
And I said ...	2	['2']	2
Shh . Somebody's out there .	4	['4']	4
He's peeing on me .	3	['3']	3
Come here , quick !	2	['2']	2
Ka - rumph ! We were smashed to port .	1, 7	['1', ' 7']	1
How come you bought one ?	7	['7']	7
You can do this ?	7	['7']	7
They're all friends of mine .	5	['5']	5
Stay with my mother ?	1, 3	['1', ' 3']	1
Don't listen to her !	4	['4']	4
Put the gun away .	1	['1']	1
even though it continues to dominate the market for sex ads .	3	['3']	3
I must be going senile .	6	['6']	6
Something that no one's ever done for him before .	5, 6	['5', ' 6']	5
I like her .	5	['5']	5
They say you offering me favours .	2	['2']	2
I love those guys .	5	['5']	5
We've got nothing to wear . What about our habits ?	3, 6	['3', ' 6']	3
You're not going to leave your friend , sir ... are you ?	4	['4']	4
How much longer ?	3	['3']	3
This is your evening .	5	['5']	5
Join my class ?	2	['2']	2
We'll be getting into [LOCATION] tonight .	2	['2']	2
We need the Sheriff .	8, 4	['8', ' 4']	8
Even if we die ?	4, 6	['4', ' 6']	4
I wonder what's on the television ?	2	['2']	2
Well , then , bacon and eggs for me .	2	['2']	2
The deal with [PERSON] was a mistake .	3, 6	['3', ' 6']	3
I'm going with you .	2	['2']	2
I am speaking strictly , [PERSON] .	1	['1']	1
Do you think you'd feel any better if I fixed you some toast and coffee ?	8	['8']	8
Oh , no , no , no . I want to hear more about this .	2, 7	['2', ' 7']	2
That brought it down .	8	['8']	8
What's your interest in this ?	1	['1']	1
All I ever do is try to make you happy .	6	['6']	6
Just the way I like 'em .	5	['5']	5
Do you really think they can do anything ?	7	['7']	7
You can do it .	8, 5	['8', ' 5']	8
Ever since the first day I laid eyes on you , I knew I had to be yours and yours alone .	5	['5']	5
Because it hurts my ears when you do it .	1	['1']	1
Assure [PERSON] that he'll be in our prayers .	8	['8']	8
Yeah , I mind .	1	['1']	1
I'm sorry , maybe you don't want any company .	6	['6']	6
But when I see you with him , I feel better .	5	['5']	5
He heard a fragment of her conversation with the mother - in - law , when it demanded what it links was it showing any thing ?	8	['8']	8
We only have minutes on safe window of operation .	2	['2']	2
Sounds awful , doesn't it ?	6	['6']	6
Home team .	2	['2']	2
You can't go down there !	7	['7']	7
Busted .	1, 4	['1', ' 4']	1
I can't wait .	2	['2']	2
How about that mess .	3	['3']	3
My unreliable helmsman failed to warn me about that .	1, 6	['1', ' 6']	1
I could ask you the same question .	1, 2	['1', ' 2']	1
Oh , shit , he's here .	4	['4']	4
What are you , my mother ?	1, 4	['1', ' 4']	1
Have you thought for a moment about her ?	1, 3	['1', ' 3']	1
That's why I love them .	8, 5	['8', ' 5']	8
If it's OK with you , I'd just like to hold 'em here in my hand .	8	['8']	8
She loves us very much .	5	['5']	5
Doc , can I go with you to the AA meeting ?	8	['8']	8
[PERSON] , I might have died a happy man .	6	['6']	6
We've got to leave .	2	['2']	2
Fuzzball's our cat .	8	['8']	8
There will come a time , when those who sit above me will want you delivered .	3	['3']	3
It almost feels like you're one of us now .	8	['8']	8
[PERSON] didn't even look at me .	7	['7']	7
Isn't that terrible !	4	['4']	4
I expect you to take care of them .	8	['8']	8
Speak up or I'll shoot .	1	['1']	1
Shangri - la on dope .	5	['5']	5
It is spoken on all channels .	8, 4	['8', ' 4']	8
I'm not fit to be a senator !	4	['4']	4
There's gonna be a great deal that we're gonna be able to accomplish , the three of us .	2, 5	['2', ' 5']	2
[PERSON] is two minutes late .	1	['1']	1
Everybody is afraid here .	4	['4']	4
We did it , Mr. [PERSON] .	2, 5	['2', ' 5']	2
My life is none of your business .	1, 3	['1', ' 3']	1
Because you know I'm gonna walk out of that court , just like I did before .	2	['2']	2
You guys don't hear nothing , cos if you did we wouldn't be sitting here .	8	['8']	8
[PERSON] , I don't want to hear it .	6	['6']	6
Amine , can you hear me ?	2	['2']	2
You disapprove , sir ?	6, 7	['6', ' 7']	6
[PERSON] , anybody who's got two fists and a good heartbeat , they got a chance .	2	['2']	2
He's got such gentle eyes .	8	['8']	8
Don't ever try to come in between , you smart - eyed slob .	3	['3']	3
The circuit is overloaded . It's your bloody exercise machine . It's not my stair stepper .	1	['1']	1
Sir , I want to see what whaling is like .	2	['2']	2
Majesty I can present ... my young daughter , the new Countess of [PERSON] ?	2, 7	['2', ' 7']	2
Think I'm an idiot ?	1, 7	['1', ' 7']	1
No , don't ! Not this one .	6	['6']	6
Pretty fresh .	5	['5']	5
We'll have him watched from now until the day he sails .	1	['1']	1
You're not trying to get a story ?	7	['7']	7
What does it say ?	2	['2']	2
Just wait and see .	2	['2']	2
They put all this nonsense into his brain .	1	['1']	1
You're not afraid , huh ?	8, 2, 7	['8', ' 2', ' 7']	8
The job's too tough for you .	3	['3']	3
You're comfortable .	5	['5']	5
Rocky , mind if I talk to you outside about a few things ?	4	['4']	4
We lost [PERSON] !	4, 6, 7	['4', ' 6', ' 7']	4
Are you nuts ?	3	['3']	3
You do look pale .	6	['6']	6
Now , they're probably gonna crown us King and Queen of the Costume Ball .	2	['2']	2
Nobody's blaming the SEALs and nobody is blaming you , [PERSON] .	8	['8']	8
[PERSON] , you're so sweet .	5	['5']	5
I've written it for you .	8	['8']	8
The Ambassador too would be delighted .	5	['5']	5
You love him ?	7	['7']	7
I'm really sorry .	6	['6']	6
You should !	2	['2']	2
All right . Let's go through it again .	2	['2']	2
Escort him out of the building .	3	['3']	3
And now , I'll show you the greatest attraction of all .	2	['2']	2
I'm not testifying .	1	['1']	1
She's two hundred years old .	7	['7']	7
I don't like it , [PERSON] .	3	['3']	3
Cool it ! Or you're gonna get the same thing your boyfriend got .	1, 2	['1', ' 2']	1
Just relax .	8	['8']	8
This train can't wait .	1	['1']	1
Your mom wasn't ... well , and she needed time to recover , to get better .	6	['6']	6
A map's no good in the outback !	1	['1']	1
We ain't had a chance to get this place too nice .	6	['6']	6
Please call me when you get settled .	2	['2']	2
If I use my last wish ...	2, 5	['2', ' 5']	2
They're having a nice little game up there with that telephone .	5	['5']	5
Act your age !	3	['3']	3
It don't look good , Miss B. I can't see any way out of this one .	8, 4	['8', ' 4']	8
Doc , I don't want to fly any more .	6	['6']	6
If I didn't know better , I'd think you didn't like it here .	8, 1	['8', ' 1']	8
He wouldn't have , unless he were discouraged and angry .	6	['6']	6
He's the only one that's ever been nice to me .	8	['8']	8
He took her out buggy - riding in the late afternoon without a chaperon ... and then he refused to marry her !	1	['1']	1
I'll kill you all !	4	['4']	4
I'm very fond of my wife and kid .	5	['5']	5
It was mainly the beer I had with dinner mixed with the pain medicine I still take for when you shot me in the ass .	1	['1']	1
I don't think this bullshit's funny .	3	['3']	3
No one asked her to worry about me ...	6	['6']	6
Unsatisfactory .	1, 3	['1', ' 3']	1
How much longer is this [PERSON] going to hold out ?	2	['2']	2
I guess since I'm here , I got no choice , huh ?	4, 6	['4', ' 6']	4
I'm very upset , [PERSON] .	1, 6	['1', ' 6']	1
What can I do for you ?	8, 2	['8', ' 2']	8
If you want him to die , shoot now .	1, 4	['1', ' 4']	1
Hello . - Never , ever pick up the phone .	1, 4	['1', ' 4']	1
I think you'll like it .	2	['2']	2
Then talk to me . Tell me what happened .	8, 2	['8', ' 2']	8
Remember , Daddy loves you .	8, 5	['8', ' 5']	8
Hi , honey .	8, 5	['8', ' 5']	8
I've been trying to find you , but ...	6	['6']	6
What the fuck are you doing now , man ?	3	['3']	3
She's got the curse .	4	['4']	4
I promise you .	8	['8']	8
I'm glad for the company .	5	['5']	5
Well , it seems to me that you have some options .	2, 5	['2', ' 5']	2
Of course , Countess !	8	['8']	8
Therefore , we do here and now band ourselves ... into a brotherhood of buccaneers ... to practice the trade of piracy on the high seas .	8	['8']	8
I love a coward !	5	['5']	5
Now , I really think this is a good place to start looking .	2	['2']	2
Does not this makes you laugh ?	7	['7']	7
No need to worry , son .	8	['8']	8
She's the one .	8, 5	['8', ' 5']	8
If I let go , I'll fall !	4	['4']	4
I want to know absolutely everything that's happened up till now .	2	['2']	2
You OK ?	2	['2']	2
You taught that guy a lesson last night .	8	['8']	8
Hey ! I can't believe you got here !	5, 7	['5', ' 7']	5
The officers of the [PERSON] in happy celebration .	5	['5']	5
Wow !	5, 7	['5', ' 7']	5
Where's [PERSON] ? Who cares ?	1, 3	['1', ' 3']	1
Are you going to come or do I have to drag you ?	1	['1']	1
She's quite right . I'll look after them for you .	8	['8']	8

Happy birthday .	5	['5']	5
You just give us the word .	8	['8']	8
Pretty sweet .	2, 5	['2', ' 5']	2
Ha , a bit bourgeois , don't you think ?	5	['5']	5
Because this could be a threat to all life on [LOCATION] if we are reckless with this issue .	1, 4, 6	['1', ' 4', ' 6']	1
And the last time you were in my office , you told me you hadn't committed a crime to get the job done .	1	['1']	1
They're not putting up the money .	1	['1']	1
You need a Puerto Rican skag peddler ?	2	['2']	2
You found courage .	8, 5	['8', ' 5']	8
You want me to think that you don't want me to go down there , but the subtle truth is you really don't want me to go down there .	1	['1']	1
What are you talking about ?	1, 2, 4, 7	['1', ' 2', ' 4', ' 7']	1
You're hanging your ass out a good long way on this one .	1, 3	['1', ' 3']	1
They didn't shut me up , you did .	1	['1']	1
[PERSON] is the best cop I ever saw .	5	['5']	5
Shake on it , bruv .	8, 5	['8', ' 5']	8
When the country needs men who have courage like never before , he's just gonna decorate a chair and get himself honoured .	3	['3']	3
I must speak to Mr [PERSON] .	2	['2']	2
But , she can be very generous sometimes .	8, 2, 5	['8', ' 2', ' 5']	8
You gave me some very valuable information .	8	['8']	8
By the way ...	4	['4']	4
You then can have agriculture and manufacturing locally that has very little cost to it .	5	['5']	5
With a little money , you can get almost anything .	5	['5']	5
Right , that's better , it's closer .	5	['5']	5
No , I don't even want to do that .	1, 6, 7	['1', ' 6', ' 7']	1
I was plenty scared .	4	['4']	4
I couldn't sleep .	6	['6']	6
He tied her up ... He beat her with some instrument and strangled her .	4	['4']	4

But it's bleeding ?	4	['4']	4
Don't even , no . Don't look at me !	3	['3']	3
Lasers ready .	8, 2	['8', ' 2']	8
I promised .	8	['8']	8
I'm gonna vomit .	3	['3']	3
Why wouldn't they have told me ?	7	['7']	7
Stick your nose back in this county , and you'll never see daylight again .	4	['4']	4
When the Vice-president calls you , I'll meet you in the centre aisle .	2	['2']	2
Then ... they actually expect you to go to work .	3	['3']	3
[PERSON] , I know you're playing with that stupid video station , What did I say about that ?	1, 3	['1', ' 3']	1
I was smart .	5	['5']	5
With [LOCATION] conquered , nothing can stand in our way .	2	['2']	2
Thirteen dead in what appears to be a Nuke money massacre .	4	['4']	4
You're home a little early , aren't you ?	7	['7']	7
What are they fighting about ?	1	['1']	1

Please , he'll crush them into wine , honey .	4	['4']	4
Time drags when you're tired .	6	['6']	6
We can't wait for it .	2	['2']	2
I'll put you back on the team , but you must promise not to drown out the other children .	1	['1']	1
What the blaze is going on here ?	7	['7']	7

Script girl .	7	['7']	7
If I need you later on , will you come over ?	8	['8']	8
[PERSON] needs me .	2	['2']	2
I said , [PERSON] , you're already married .	7	['7']	7
Bless you . Father , how can I possibly thank you ?	8	['8']	8
No , he's no [LOCATION] .	4	['4']	4
That's cutting 'em down to size !	1	['1']	1
You ain't gonna get nobody to come out here .	1	['1']	1
I doubt a court of inquiry will accept that .	6, 7	['6', ' 7']	6
He's quite right . There's nothing wrong with eating dog .	8, 5, 7	['8', ' 5', ' 7']	8
It's yours , Shooter .	2, 5	['2', ' 5']	2
I hated you ...	3	['3']	3
I don't want any luck .	1	['1']	1
He's probably walking around here , lost .	6	['6']	6
Unfortunately he has a habit of wasting taxpayers ' money .	3	['3']	3
Look out below !	7	['7']	7
Dickhead .	1	['1']	1

Boy , wait'll they see what we found .	2	['2']	2
They're two nice Jewish boys from [LOCATION] .	2	['2']	2
We didn't hear that .	4	['4']	4
My scarf . Where's my -- ?	7	['7']	7
I know . I don't want to say . I know how upset you'll be . I know how upset I was .	8, 4	['8', ' 4']	8
Stop , please .	4	['4']	4
I'll put money in his bank anytime .	8	['8']	8
Come on ! Let's go !	2	['2']	2
There's no hard feelings between us .	5	['5']	5
It's dangerous , but it just might work .	2	['2']	2
Fingers crossed , [PERSON] .	8, 2, 5	['8', ' 2', ' 5']	8
I can wind this one up in six weeks .	5	['5']	5
I'm not proud of that .	3	['3']	3
He never spoke .	3	['3']	3
I wish I could share your confidence .	6	['6']	6
They want names . I give them names .	1	['1']	1
Boy , you should have been there .	5	['5']	5
Boys , sweep them out of the gutter .	3	['3']	3
You had a shot in Public Domain where you looked at the camera , into me and I loved you .	5	['5']	5
Well , I will be very glad to hear it .	2	['2']	2
Now , with such simplicity ... Such clarity , everything falls into place .	6	['6']	6
So I guess growing up in the wetback section of [LOCATION] wasn't that bad .	2, 5	['2', ' 5']	2
So you can see [PERSON] is deep in trouble .	4	['4']	4
And you wan na know what else I think ?	1	['1']	1
My offer is a very fair one , and doesn't even take advantage of your situation .	8	['8']	8
And that's another reason why you don't speak about it .	4	['4']	4
Then you weren't angry because I wasn't there ?	7	['7']	7
An evil spirit took by corpse and won't let me rest in peace	3, 6	['3', ' 6']	3
Those of you in favor of these articles , raise your right hands and say aye !	8	['8']	8
There never was any love lost between us .	5	['5']	5
Even though we were close , even though you betrayed me , and I trusted you , I would never harm you .	8, 5	['8', ' 5']	8
She just seems , I don't know , lonely .	6	['6']	6
I got a lousy temper and an awful accent . I sound toffee - nosed .	3	['3']	3
That is the original invitation .	2, 5	['2', ' 5']	2
We could have backed him up .	6	['6']	6
He was kind and thoughtful and happy about my success .	5	['5']	5
What's up , boss ?	2	['2']	2
I'll hide you somewhere .	4	['4']	4
And I want to thank you for making me join the Army .	8	['8']	8
I'll kill you .	1	['1']	1
Frank . The Benzedrine's got my teeth wiggling .	3	['3']	3
I don't want to hear this !	1, 3, 6, 7	['1', ' 3', ' 6', ' 7']	1
You have exact change ?	2	['2']	2
You'll need more than just two of us .	8, 1	['8', ' 1']	8
You're going down	1	['1']	1
by getting blackout drunk .	3	['3']	3
You're a good person .	8	['8']	8
Lots of votes taken , but nothing has happened .	1, 3, 6	['1', ' 3', ' 6']	1
You know , holding that baby in your arms for the first time ... it changes your life .	5	['5']	5
I can't understand half of them and I used to be a lawyer .	6	['6']	6
Yes ? - The keys !	4	['4']	4
He thought it was sinful .	3	['3']	3
Otherwise you'll never get out of [LOCATION] alive .	4	['4']	4
What's that noise ?	4	['4']	4
lt's beautiful .	8, 5	['8', ' 5']	8
You are right .	8	['8']	8
I'll disinherit him .	3	['3']	3
You ain't got no place to go , [PERSON] .	6	['6']	6
If they find out you're FBI , we have a problem .	4	['4']	4
Suspicious old goat .	3	['3']	3
He'll lay out the plan of operation for you .	2	['2']	2
Sure , you're fine , you've got plenty .	5	['5']	5
Decker won't tell anyone .	8	['8']	8
There they are , they must have found her !	8, 7	['8', ' 7']	8
Yeah , I might be going to Yale .	2	['2']	2
Oh , that's delicious .	5	['5']	5
This should impress the bankers .	2	['2']	2
And what are you focused on now ?	2, 3	['2', ' 3']	2
Get in the drawing room , lock the door . Don't let anybody in . Don't answer for anybody , all right ?	4	['4']	4
I'm in love !	5	['5']	5
God , she must really love you .	7	['7']	7

[PERSON] , I - I - I love you .	4	['4']	4
You got ta settle down or you're gonna wake him up .	8, 6, 7	['8', ' 6', ' 7']	8
You're a killer .	3	['3']	3
Look how stupid you're acting .	3	['3']	3
Those dopes are trying to crack open the safe .	3	['3']	3
She'll lend you an air of respectability if that's possible .	3	['3']	3
You put your head in the sand .	1	['1']	1
It concerns me !	4	['4']	4
Coffee will be ready soon .	2	['2']	2
It's your fault .	3	['3']	3
Did not it have to be resting ? Yes .	1	['1']	1
You're the hero of the hour .	8	['8']	8
So maybe death isn't the end , [PERSON] .	2	['2']	2
There I disagree with you .	1	['1']	1
Carol , I want you to transcribe these notes for my report .	8	['8']	8
The blood's rushing to my head .	1, 4	['1', ' 4']	1
Francis ! Pay the guy , will you ?	1	['1']	1

They can go to hell !	1	['1']	1

Stop calling me , please .	1, 3, 4, 6	['1', ' 3', ' 4', ' 6']	1
lt was [PERSON] . - How do you - l tailed him .	7	['7']	7
Don't try anything rash , or you're dead along with everyone else .	4	['4']	4
I appreciate your letting me come .	8	['8']	8
But that's another story , and a very unpleasant one , too .	6	['6']	6
I'd love to go with you , Mr. [PERSON] .	2	['2']	2
All I can charge him with is riding on a train . They're gonna walk .	1	['1']	1
Nothing but talk .	3	['3']	3
* So get up out of your bed	1	['1']	1
You said she was coming with us .	7	['7']	7
You got ta fix this mess , be it how you fix it with your girl , or how you fix it with [PERSON] , cos I just know my daughter doesn't deserve to be involved in this .	6, 7	['6', ' 7']	6
You are probably an embezzler .	3	['3']	3
I'll risk it .	2, 5	['2', ' 5']	2
You think I got this job because I fucked some fat - cat friend of [PERSON]'s .	1	['1']	1
How'd we do ?	2	['2']	2
Explain yourself .	1	['1']	1
What are you trying to say ?	1	['1']	1
He wanted me ,	2, 4	['2', ' 4']	2
Hey , [PERSON] .	2, 5, 7	['2', ' 5', ' 7']	2
Like one time , I was with this guy and he came into my bedroom and he was naked , except he still had his socks on .	7	['7']	7
What does that mean ?	1, 2, 4	['1', ' 2', ' 4']	1
You're the most beautiful person I ever met .	5	['5']	5
I'm not feeling well . This won't take long .	6	['6']	6
But , in a democracy , we do not shoot unarmed suspects on sight for a murder in which their participation is still unproven .	3	['3']	3
Let me be the first to welcome you to this land of milk and honey .	2	['2']	2
We must leave tonight .	6	['6']	6
I think you can .	8	['8']	8
I couldn't make the rent . I was too ashamed to go home .	6	['6']	6
As a matter of fact , you look great .	5	['5']	5
Would you like me to go with you ?	8	['8']	8
No , I don't like it .	3, 6, 7	['3', ' 6', ' 7']	3
I've got some sandwiches in my pack .	5	['5']	5
Oh yeah , that's you .	3	['3']	3
I still haven't recovered No energy to jump	6	['6']	6
I'm gonna say , this is a crucial moment . For both of you .	2	['2']	2
Well , we won't stand for it .	1	['1']	1
This tureen holds as much sand as we had strawberries tonight .	3, 6	['3', ' 6']	3
It hurts , hurts , hurts .	6	['6']	6
But come sit for a minute .	2	['2']	2
Is there anything you want to tell us ?	1, 2	['1', ' 2']	1

I sure hate to lose her for some reason or other .	1	['1']	1
Wait , wait , I can't do it from here .	4	['4']	4
You see , [PERSON] , this is a respectable business and there's nothing wrong with that .	8	['8']	8
Of course they're armed and dangerous .	1	['1']	1
To have an ugly incident occur while we're on this train with no method of escape that is not in our self - interest , either .	1, 4	['1', ' 4']	1
That's a good thing to know , [PERSON] .	8	['8']	8
Sephardic .	1	['1']	1
Or am I going mad ?	4	['4']	4
I was desperate .	4	['4']	4
I tell you , our side will always win .	8, 5	['8', ' 5']	8
So that's what those things are for .	7	['7']	7
You bet !	5	['5']	5
I'd like to see an [PERSON] administration .	8, 2	['8', ' 2']	8
But we like to be on a first - name basis with potential candidates .	8	['8']	8
Someone will take care of you right away .	8	['8']	8
They're coming here ... to [LOCATION] .	4	['4']	4
Well , she helped me .	8	['8']	8

It must have been here all day .	7	['7']	7
Yes , son , I'm afraid .	4	['4']	4
I want these pots so shiny I can see my face in them !	2, 5	['2', ' 5']	2
I am not powerful enough	6	['6']	6
Yes , it'll be a pity if this doesn't come off , too .	6	['6']	6
I will , if you don't stop nagging me .	1	['1']	1
Your mommy took you to the hospital because you were hurt .	7	['7']	7
Trying to kill me . Is that it ?	1	['1']	1
Yeah !	5, 7	['5', ' 7']	5
To do that would cause worldwide panic .	4	['4']	4
I don't like this .	3, 4	['3', ' 4']	3
What did he tell you to tell me ?	1, 2	['1', ' 2']	1
And I don't like nobody touching my stuff !	3	['3']	3
I hate jumping out of a perfectly good airplane .	1	['1']	1
No . ls someone looking for me ?	7	['7']	7
You know what they say about black cops in the ghetto ?	2, 4	['2', ' 4']	2
You're just spoiled . You've thrown everything away .	1, 3	['1', ' 3']	1
Martial law .	4	['4']	4
I'll call you later .	2	['2']	2
This is war !	1	['1']	1
Good evening , lieutenant .	5	['5']	5
Don't fuck me up .	1, 2	['1', ' 2']	1
Are you sure ?	4	['4']	4
The dove was a ghost ?	7	['7']	7
We're due for five days of sunshine .	2	['2']	2
Is [PERSON] really dead ?	4, 6	['4', ' 6']	4
[PERSON] fucking christ . - $ ? - Yes , sir .	1, 7	['1', ' 7']	1
Can you play the balalaika ? Can she play ?	2	['2']	2
Fuck , he's not dead !	7	['7']	7
Congress made a clear policy choice in enacting Section of the Communications Decency Act , and the choice was to preserve free speech on the internet ,	2	['2']	2
Our train leaves early tomorrow morning .	2	['2']	2
Why the hell did you think that was an appropriate thing to do ?	1	['1']	1
Thank you for a lovely evening .	5	['5']	5
So what'd you do ?	4	['4']	4
I know you always say you're not like him . But here you are , scrubbing up for the next surgery instead of fighting for the man that you love .	3	['3']	3
I'll respect you even more .	8	['8']	8
And this smog doesn't help anyway .	3	['3']	3
And that's the only way to make change , is to make your voice known .	8, 4	['8', ' 4']	8
A safety - first Clyde .	8, 5	['8', ' 5']	8
She didn't become a Hexenbiest because she wanted to .	3, 6	['3', ' 6']	3
That is not true .  	1	['1']	1
I haven't been , uh , entirely honest With you , and , uh ...	4	['4']	4
We'll all squeeze in .	8	['8']	8
Unfortunately , I have to return to my children now .	6	['6']	6
Remember , when you invited me ?	7	['7']	7
Let's kill him now .	1, 3	['1', ' 3']	1
I'll be in the hotel lobby : sharp .	2, 5	['2', ' 5']	2
He sounds terrific .	2, 5	['2', ' 5']	2
There's a village back there , and you know they got some girls there that would just --	2	['2']	2
It's been ... a rewarding experience to watch a great artist at work .	8, 5, 7	['8', ' 5', ' 7']	8
Tonight , I hand in my resignation .	2	['2']	2
Yeah , but you're going to win .	2	['2']	2
Do you like the song ?	2, 5	['2', ' 5']	2
The bite ... was mine .	6, 7	['6', ' 7']	6
My pleasure , sisters .	5	['5']	5
You're not making any sense .	1, 3	['1', ' 3']	1
They are the tears of Old [LOCATION] .	6	['6']	6
I've been very patient , [PERSON] .	2	['2']	2
I remembered why I loved paintings in the first place , what got me into this .	5	['5']	5
I wan na say I appreciate what Capt. [PERSON]'s done on my behalf .	8	['8']	8
If we can force them to come in and face us , we might actually have a chance to overpower them and escape .	2, 3, 5	['2', ' 3', ' 5']	2
Deeply grateful .	8	['8']	8
I have no patience for any more shit .	8, 1	['8', ' 1']	8
The men are anxious to celebrate , Captain , and they're waiting on you .	2	['2']	2
I felt obliged to come and pay my respects before moving on .	8	['8']	8
Just stay out of this .	1	['1']	1
We want to thank you all for making our lives just a little brighter , here on We Love Radio .	8	['8']	8
My lawyer will get all this information , along with a doctor's report about my stomach and her ankle .	1	['1']	1
Well , [PERSON] seems divinely happy .	5	['5']	5
Yes , she did . I speak to your secretary more than I speak to you .	3	['3']	3
Concocted all kinds of false information about weapons of mass destruction which [PERSON] did not have , and it was known in intelligence circles he didn't have .	1, 3	['1', ' 3']	1
She told about the squalor and filth into which she and her brother were born , and how they grew up like animals .	3, 6, 7	['3', ' 6', ' 7']	3
All I'm askin' for is a chance .	8, 2, 6	['8', ' 2', ' 6']	8
Who took her body ?	7	['7']	7
Ma damn foot's caught in the door !	1	['1']	1

You spoil me for death .	3	['3']	3
Who appear to be inconvenient , or troublesome through knowing too much .	4	['4']	4
For us , business is lousy .	6	['6']	6
Somebody will listen to me .	2	['2']	2
That monster is so tall , it'll see us if he stands up straight	2, 4, 7	['2', ' 4', ' 7']	2
It was self - defence , for [PERSON]'s sake !	1	['1']	1
Give him a good laugh .	5	['5']	5
We have to keep on what we've been doing and break him .	1	['1']	1
He didn't know ...	6	['6']	6
Admiring the view , [PERSON] ?	5	['5']	5
Must have been watching out that window for hours .	7	['7']	7
I don't think even that would do it .	6	['6']	6
I'm sorry about this .	6	['6']	6

Don't text me .	1, 3	['1', ' 3']	1
If your men are as cocksure as you are , they might get through .	8	['8']	8
I thought you wouldn't see [PERSON] now you're back with [PERSON] .	7	['7']	7

To tell you the truth , [LOCATION] frightens me .	4	['4']	4
I'd never fuck with you , because I really love you guys .	8, 4	['8', ' 4']	8
So you and me are gonna make a little arrangement .	1, 2	['1', ' 2']	1
What the fuck are you eating ?	3	['3']	3
I must admit , you put some very convincing arguments on this table .	8	['8']	8
What are you staring at ?	1	['1']	1
Don't want that , now , do we ?	2, 4	['2', ' 4']	2
You don't seem the least bit worried about the pending charges against your secretary .	7	['7']	7
I got nothin' to lose .	8	['8']	8
Mr. [PERSON] , this is your son's girlfriend .	8, 1	['8', ' 1']	8
She's a wonderful wife to me , too .	5	['5']	5
What's in the pot ?	2	['2']	2

Green pastures await the tired sinner , and honey flows like water .	2, 5	['2', ' 5']	2
It would adore . [PERSON] , [PERSON] , come to my office a moment .	5	['5']	5
[PERSON] , they're going to kill you !	4	['4']	4

Do you think we'd better let it go at that ?	3	['3']	3

Well , you said the name of the boat on television . I knew it was [PERSON]'s .	7	['7']	7
I mean , he makes a very fine officer .	8	['8']	8
That means jobs we can all be proud of . And make Made in [LOCATION]  mean something again . 	2	['2']	2
It's love at first sight .	5	['5']	5
He's as bad as his uncle .	3	['3']	3
You take a rest now .	8	['8']	8
Shot by a mad pharmacist or run over by a car while fleeing from police pursuit .	3	['3']	3
You're lying !	3	['3']	3
You're not going anywhere , scuzzball !	1	['1']	1
Can we have coffee ?	2	['2']	2

I'll listen , but I can't guarantee how long .	1, 2, 4, 7, 8	['1', ' 2', ' 4', ' 7', ' 8']	1
How'd you get in there ?	2, 7	['2', ' 7']	2
A lot of people are going to pay for this night .	1	['1']	1
Fucking [GAY SLUR] .	1, 3	['1', ' 3']	1
Aren't things bad enough without you talking about dying ?	1	['1']	1
Yes , but he's in his office ... [PERSON] , can you believe this ? They just faxed me the chewgood numbers .	5	['5']	5
Don't look at me with those soft - boiled eggs .	1	['1']	1

And now they need a new one .	2	['2']	2
I'll hit him !	1	['1']	1
You'll have parades in your honour .	8	['8']	8
I can't .	1, 6, 7	['1', ' 6', ' 7']	1
Wiggle your ear . Wiggle your toes . Come on .	5	['5']	5

Anybody connected with drugs deserves to die .	3	['3']	3
I don't get your generation's humour .	3, 6, 7	['3', ' 6', ' 7']	3
Get a message off to [LOCATION] .	8	['8']	8

Don't burn yourself , [PERSON] .	4	['4']	4
In this order we're not allowed personal possessions . Nor are we .	1	['1']	1
Do you like that one ? - Yeah .	5	['5']	5
That's the first thing Cross taught me .	8	['8']	8
I've got bad news for you , GJ .	6	['6']	6
And there's nobody to tell me that the results are anything but brilliant , so I live in a comfortable glow of self - appreciation .	5	['5']	5
It's very funny , [PERSON] . Don't move !	5	['5']	5
Hey , if you think I look bad , you oughta see the other guy's knuckles .	7	['7']	7
He'll kill me if he has to .	4	['4']	4

I'll have to write it all over again .	6	['6']	6
You're a fool .	1, 3	['1', ' 3']	1
That's one of the things I hope the formula will alleviate .	2	['2']	2
That ain't gonna last forever .	4, 6	['4', ' 6']	4
That's right . The last thing we want is an international incident .	3	['3']	3

They'll be here tomorrow , honey .	2	['2']	2
So we'll go to the [LOCATION] .	2	['2']	2

Indeed throughout the entire interview ... he insisted they call him [PERSON] which is his right name and refused to answer to the name of [PERSON] .  	3	['3']	3
They would have waited forever to go into that bank .	1, 2	['1', ' 2']	1
You want to know something interesting ?	8	['8']	8
The fairy tale again .	1	['1']	1
This is so embarrassing .	3	['3']	3

You dreamt I lost some weight ?	7	['7']	7
What do you think is right ?	2	['2']	2
One that will scream in the middle of the night and you'll have to stumble downstairs in the dark and change his soiled diapers .	3, 6	['3', ' 6']	3

[PERSON] , why don't you take your coat off and stay awhile ?	2	['2']	2
Their screams ... you never forget something like that .	1, 3, 4, 6	['1', ' 3', ' 4', ' 6']	1
I know , under the circumstances , it's a bit much but you have a unique knowledge for our purpose .	8	['8']	8
Would you care for some coffee ?	8	['8']	8
You're gonna get the shakes soon , [PERSON] .	4	['4']	4
Were you alone ? - Yes .	7	['7']	7
One of my biggest disappointments over the last years is those who lack the courage of their convictions .	1, 3, 6, 7	['1', ' 3', ' 6', ' 7']	1

Don't misunderstand me .	4	['4']	4
I don't want the money if this is how you have to earn it !	1	['1']	1
That task force is headed this way .	4	['4']	4
What didn't work ?	2	['2']	2
It depends on what you're looking for .	3	['3']	3
Don't you like children ?	7	['7']	7
[PERSON] , we're here because of you .	8, 5	['8', ' 5']	8
Are you suggesting that I killed those women ?	4	['4']	4
And what sort of rubbish are you turning out now ?	1	['1']	1
I was holding her in my arms ...	4, 6	['4', ' 6']	4
I will give him an alibi and I shall be very convincing .	8	['8']	8
You damned near got us all killed .	1	['1']	1
We shot with it .	8, 5	['8', ' 5']	8
The idea that Backpage is just trying to cater to fetishes of old men , doesn't really involve underage children ,	3	['3']	3
Certainly making a fool of yourself .	3	['3']	3
The other day , you looked like you were still hurting .	6	['6']	6
WTF . What am I supposed to do about the tour guide ?	1, 4, 7	['1', ' 4', ' 7']	1
It is so nice to meet you .	5	['5']	5
Well , he'd better be if he's gonna remain anything at all .	1	['1']	1

Have you been drinking ?	3	['3']	3
[PERSON] ?	2, 4, 7	['2', ' 4', ' 7']	2
We don't want speeches .	1	['1']	1
I had no idea you were so beautiful .	5	['5']	5
Why don't I drive up to this place with you and check it out ?	2	['2']	2
I think I just became the first president to ever publicly mention Area .	2	['2']	2
So , we are definitely on then ?	2, 5	['2', ' 5']	2
How did you get to be a captain ?	3	['3']	3
We're going around in circles .	1	['1']	1
I thought you were a confirmed private .	7	['7']	7
Tri Face !	7	['7']	7
Isn't this just fabulous ?	5	['5']	5
Hadn't they promised to keep our name out of it ?	7	['7']	7
Slow down or you'll get a ticket !	4	['4']	4
They threatened to kill me if I didn't pay .	4	['4']	4
What are you doing ? All right , come on .	7	['7']	7
Holy Moses .	7	['7']	7
It was them ! They sent it !	5, 7	['5', ' 7']	5

Go to bed at night happy and then murdered .	4	['4']	4
[PERSON] , give me a hand .	8, 1	['8', ' 1']	8
Better jump into the tree and hide	2, 4	['2', ' 4']	2
I'm not getting any younger !	2, 4	['2', ' 4']	2
What'd you wan na write that for ?	1	['1']	1
So , the ring ? - No .	1	['1']	1
Like your shoes , it's a miracle she lasted as long as she did .	7	['7']	7
Isn't the reverse possible ?	2, 4	['2', ' 4']	2
By the way , any messages for me ?	2	['2']	2
Hey , is that [PERSON] ?	7	['7']	7
I'm gonna name her mommy .	8, 5	['8', ' 5']	8

Every time it rains , it gets all yucky .	3	['3']	3
No , no , no , no , no .	1, 4, 6	['1', ' 4', ' 6']	1
The cellar is the only safe place .	4	['4']	4
A rather odd reaction .	7	['7']	7
I wan na know whose idea it was to have children .	3	['3']	3
That's how marriages are arranged down here .	8, 1	['8', ' 1']	8
Who's got time to wonder what happened to some ridiculous talking mice when you're driving by at 75 , miles an hour ?	3	['3']	3
Oh , shit .	4, 6	['4', ' 6']	4
Thank you for keeping us alive .	8	['8']	8
Now you're lying .	3	['3']	3
Sometimes they have an accident .	6	['6']	6
Hey . Good work .	5	['5']	5

There's speculation that he's already ...	4	['4']	4
Anyone in your vicinity is in danger .	4	['4']	4
Please ... No ...	4	['4']	4
And don't try anything funny , cos you know what you'll get .	1	['1']	1
I , on the other hand , had beaten them at their own system and subsequently [PERSON] rather effortlessly , floating up from mere marketing through the corridors of policy and on to the board and along the way promoting [PERSON]	2, 5	['2', ' 5']	2
It's another little reminder of why we pulled this thing .	1, 2	['1', ' 2']	1
It's kicks , but I'm not under contract to 'em and I got a strong feeling option time is right around the corner .	2	['2']	2
The agricultural use is one of the exceptions , fortunately .	5	['5']	5
Thank you , sir .	8, 5	['8', ' 5']	8
Half of [LOCATION]'s on the way up here .	2, 7	['2', ' 7']	2
You asked for second helpings .	1	['1']	1
All I can do is release you to make your own estimate of the situation .	8	['8']	8
It looks better on you .	7	['7']	7
Don't forget the cannibals .	4	['4']	4
Can't you see I'm playing pool , bruv ?	1, 7	['1', ' 7']	1

Pull yourself together and I'll let you go .	1	['1']	1
I didn't know what to do .	4	['4']	4
He don't care about you and he don't care about me neither .	6	['6']	6
You boys hungry ?	2	['2']	2
A woman who drinks is bad enough and I will not stand for a woman cursing and blaspheming God .	1, 3	['1', ' 3']	1
Is this record correct or not ?	1	['1']	1
I'm always hiding from him , but he finds me .	1	['1']	1
It's blackmail , pure and simple .	3	['3']	3
I was taking out on her what I should have been giving you !	3	['3']	3
Did you got , like , baby einstein show with him ?	1	['1']	1
That was some road trip .	7	['7']	7
I wouldn't want him to think I'm not sympathetic .	6	['6']	6
I will drink to that !	5	['5']	5
If you lay one finger on that poor , sweet , helpless girl ... you'll despise yourself forever .	3	['3']	3
The day is warm and bright	5	['5']	5
You make me laugh .	5	['5']	5
Hi , [PERSON] . I'm sorry I didn't get to send you a card yet about your wife .	6	['6']	6
I'm not exactly ashamed of that one myself .	5	['5']	5
They've done things with my body and the bodies of others ...	4	['4']	4
I will get off there and my chauffeur will take you to your destination .	8	['8']	8
Neighbors like each other , speak to each other , care if anybody lives or dies .	1	['1']	1
In her medicine cabinet ?	7	['7']	7
I told you to keep away from that radio .	1	['1']	1
If I thought I needed an assistant to do my job ... meaning what ?	1	['1']	1
Pay attention to me .	1	['1']	1
You're becoming more beautiful every day .	5	['5']	5
He will help us . I'm sure that still loves you .	8, 2, 5	['8', ' 2', ' 5']	8
Smuggle their manuscripts out to the [LOCATION] ?	7	['7']	7
Look at the rosy cheeks .	5	['5']	5
Charlie ! Sorry .	8, 4, 7	['8', ' 4', ' 7']	8
It was horrible for him .	6	['6']	6
You need money , and quickly .	4	['4']	4
Maybe it's me and [PERSON] .	7	['7']	7
Son of a bitch !	1, 3	['1', ' 3']	1
Thank God .	5, 7	['5', ' 7']	5
You don't have to call me Father .	8	['8']	8
It's not mine . Do you still claim you have an identical scarf ?	1	['1']	1
You are from the warship that attacked me , are you not ?	1	['1']	1
I know you women got ta pretend to be offended .	3	['3']	3
I try to help , but he doesn't listen to me , and I've got my own grief to work through .	6	['6']	6
I'm tired of being pawed .	1	['1']	1
That's disgusting !	3	['3']	3
Son of a bitch .	1, 3	['1', ' 3']	1
With your popularity , you'd be out in no time .	1	['1']	1
You better be home tonight , you [GAY SLUR] .	1	['1']	1
There'd be less bills if you didn't raise the kids like I was a millionaire .	3	['3']	3
I could burn in hell for the lies I told about you .	6	['6']	6
She believes that her father has incestuous desires .	3	['3']	3
We have a complication .	4	['4']	4
She looks like a jelly doughnut , doesn't she ?	3	['3']	3
Och , you don't want to let them worry you .	8	['8']	8
I will pray for you .	8	['8']	8
Give me the suit , right now .	1	['1']	1
Are you abandoning the search ?	7	['7']	7
Isn't it wonderful ?	5	['5']	5
It just makes me feel real glad to see the Chiefs back on the warpath again ... to coin a phrase .	5	['5']	5
Oh , this is so cool !	2, 5, 7	['2', ' 5', ' 7']	2
I'm giving you the chance .	8	['8']	8
He's taken it again !	1	['1']	1
You are an old man who will make trouble with his mouth .	3	['3']	3
Come to Papa .	2	['2']	2
Come live with me And be my love	2	['2']	2
I can be president of the [LOCATION] !	7	['7']	7
Now , that's something .	5	['5']	5
You've failed .	1, 3, 6	['1', ' 3', ' 6']	1
And no promises on the sentence .	3, 6	['3', ' 6']	3
Ugh ! Shocking !	3, 4, 7	['3', ' 4', ' 7']	3
I fancy something a bit sporty . - That one .	2, 5	['2', ' 5']	2
My heart behaved like a fool .	6	['6']	6
Even if this room gets filled with lies like these and the Taylors and all their armies come marching into this place .	3	['3']	3
Ruuuuuth !	1	['1']	1
Don't make me laugh .	5	['5']	5
I'm so scared my bones are clicking , like dice on a [PERSON] crap table .	4	['4']	4
So now that you're a good guy , what about the bad guys ?	2	['2']	2
These stalls are awfully dirty and they're backed up .	3	['3']	3
All my powers have gone .	6	['6']	6
Gentlemen , gentlemen . You don't understand .	8, 5, 6	['8', ' 5', ' 6']	8
You've got a customer .	8, 2	['8', ' 2']	8
I love this !	5	['5']	5
I always feel rejuvenated by a touch of adventure .	2	['2']	2
I'm not takin' a shower with him .	3	['3']	3
But I'll speak with you later .	2	['2']	2
Yes , but if we use it , we'll win .	8, 1, 2	['8', ' 1', ' 2']	8
Aw , [PERSON] , now what ?	3	['3']	3
That's not good .	6	['6']	6
Vice President of the local Vagos .	8	['8']	8
What does my height have to do with anything ?	7	['7']	7
Perhaps I have become , as you put it , obsessed by our name and our past , and the absence of our future , and by our paintings .	1, 4, 6	['1', ' 4', ' 6']	1
Tell the boys anyone caught arguing with a depositor will be fired .	1	['1']	1
I also understand that I care very much what happens to you .	8	['8']	8
I think he wants to die .	2, 6	['2', ' 6']	2
I tried to make him see a psychiatrist .	4	['4']	4
And people do the strangest things , too .	7	['7']	7
You're sure we're not , uh , crowding you , eh ?	4	['4']	4
You're making me look bad .	1, 6	['1', ' 6']	1
But ...	2, 6	['2', ' 6']	2
Why are you smiling , you silly bastard ?	3	['3']	3
Have them send me up some roast chicken and chocolate pudding .	2	['2']	2
Bring him .	1, 3	['1', ' 3']	1
Terrific !	5	['5']	5
You darling , [PERSON] !	5	['5']	5
I'll give you the money .	8	['8']	8
That'll be all , steward .	1	['1']	1
He knew my father very well .	8	['8']	8
Set compressors and prime !	2	['2']	2
You look fabulous .	5	['5']	5
You're not talking to this guy .	3	['3']	3
But to speak of this , to anyone , would bring dire consequences .	4, 6	['4', ' 6']	4
[PERSON] , I can't subpoena those records without a legitimate client .	1	['1']	1
Let's see what [PERSON] has for dinner .	2	['2']	2
And if they try to , they'll find you dead .	1	['1']	1
This is junk .	3	['3']	3
Where are you taking me ?	4	['4']	4
The military that uses the war machines and justifies them , and then the intelligence community that is not really an intelligence community , it's a covert operations community , armed with military weapons and nuclear weapons , and that they're trying to push the boundaries now	1, 4	['1', ' 4']	1
Good to see you again , friend .	5	['5']	5
It's tough being left out , isn't it ?	6	['6']	6
Have fun , sweetie ?	5	['5']	5
Well , you know what I think ? I think you wouldn't be here if she did nothing wrong .	1, 6	['1', ' 6']	1
I just don't want it to happen to my sisters , or your kids , or the next kid .	4	['4']	4
Was the public in danger as a result of the accident ?	4	['4']	4
You got it bad .	3, 6	['3', ' 6']	3
Wherever you got that specimen from , Doctor ... You sent it to the chemist ... While you were secretly communicating with Mr. [PERSON] ...	3	['3']	3
We can go to the Fairmont ...	6	['6']	6
Now , don't be a child .	3	['3']	3
This itself may have placed the entire country's safety in jeopardy .	4	['4']	4
As it happens , you are hardly in a position to have anything to say about it .	3	['3']	3
We've got you , clear .	8	['8']	8
It's kind of sad , though . All that money and nobody to enjoy it .	6	['6']	6
I called him a liar .	1	['1']	1
Not like a scientist , like an ... artist .	2, 7	['2', ' 7']	2
That's lovely .	5	['5']	5
It's like falling off a log .	6	['6']	6
You're going into the arena alone .	1	['1']	1
Try the freeze  curse ! 	2	['2']	2
Hello , [PERSON] .	2, 5, 7	['2', ' 5', ' 7']	2
No , no parties for me .	1, 6	['1', ' 6']	1
They're right .	8	['8']	8
It sounds to me like you have an agenda .	4	['4']	4
I'm glad you're making new friends .	2, 5	['2', ' 5']	2
Do tell me more about her .	2	['2']	2
That's a real nice sound to wake up to .	5	['5']	5
I wish you'd tell Marigold to shut her silly old face .	3	['3']	3
Follow me !	2	['2']	2
You won't be needing this anymore and I think your boyfriend's had his gut full of races !	1	['1']	1
I got enough to put you away for a long vacation . So like it or not , as of now you're working for me , understand ?	1, 3	['1', ' 3']	1
I am so sorry . Hi , buddy !	8, 4	['8', ' 4']	8
I'll do it .	8	['8']	8
Go with it , quick ! Do not stop .	1	['1']	1
We should get rid of the kid and buy a new cat !	1, 5	['1', ' 5']	1
Maybe you're sorry you married me now , [PERSON] .	6	['6']	6
Judge , it's our theory that Mr. [PERSON] is being framed in this case .	7	['7']	7
Children , I have bad news for you .	6	['6']	6
Oh , it will be a beautiful attack .	2	['2']	2
Let's find something to eat .	2	['2']	2
A dollar's a dollar , and every dollar is taking me further West .	2	['2']	2
I don't have to get any place but out . Share a cab ?	8, 2	['8', ' 2']	8
If you press here , you can make drawings .	2	['2']	2
Fuck only knows why [PERSON] lets them in .	1, 3	['1', ' 3']	1
Inside there's a huge creature	2, 4	['2', ' 4']	2
The dog's mine to kill , an eye for an eye .	1	['1']	1
Doctor , can a sane man possibly perform offensive or foolish acts ?	6	['6']	6
She did what ?	7	['7']	7
And whoever holds [LOCATION] points a dagger at the heart of [LOCATION] .	1	['1']	1
He got what he wanted .	7	['7']	7
I'm busy as the devil !	1	['1']	1
Because it was my misery .	6	['6']	6
Unlock the door .	2	['2']	2
We mustn't forget we wasted a month through an unfortunate disagreement for which I was not to blame .	3	['3']	3
It was quite a scene .	2	['2']	2
I think you tell better jokes than me , [PERSON] .	8	['8']	8
I'm here to admit you and , God willing , help you .	2	['2']	2
He calls back , and this time he's very frightened .	4	['4']	4
[PERSON] was killed .	6	['6']	6
They laugh and kiss , then they scream and beat each other .	7	['7']	7
[PERSON] , you'll come with me ?	2	['2']	2
There must be a reason for this .	8	['8']	8
Mayii : His stomach was acting up like a schnauzer in heat . Would they believe him ?	2	['2']	2
Who wants to be first ?	2	['2']	2
They're here .	2	['2']	2
I'm going to see if I can talk to that young girl .	2	['2']	2
You're beautiful , [PERSON] , but sometimes you have the bad breath of priests .	3	['3']	3
It ain't worth it .	1	['1']	1
All hands to rescue stations !	1, 2, 4	['1', ' 2', ' 4']	1
Here's to bigger and better dopes .	5	['5']	5
Well , I'm here to have a dialogue .	8, 2, 3	['8', ' 2', ' 3']	8
You do it again , and you lose a limb .	1, 4	['1', ' 4']	1
Boy , is that hot !	7	['7']	7
You guys , I'm so excited !	2, 5	['2', ' 5']	2
Nobody eats that shit .	3	['3']	3
Why didn't your operator look at the other indicators ?	7	['7']	7
You gonna play the Kid ?	2	['2']	2
No , get away from her you fucking old bitch !	1, 3	['1', ' 3']	1
That's all you can do . You're right . You're absolutely right .	1	['1']	1
I have a gift for you .	5	['5']	5
You should try it .	2	['2']	2
Just our usual .	8	['8']	8
In this world full of hatred a man who knows that one rule has a great trust .	8	['8']	8
I promised my body to a woman tonight .	2	['2']	2
What sort of a man are you ?	7	['7']	7
His Majesty is very demanding .	1, 7	['1', ' 7']	1
See you in the [LOCATION] , [PERSON] .	2	['2']	2
Listen to me . [PERSON] is out there right now busting his ass to fix everything .	1	['1']	1
Sucker .	1	['1']	1
Have Doc take a look at him .	8	['8']	8
Even if I were wearing a wire , this noise would wreck the tape .	1	['1']	1
Miss , you can be quite sure that I shall report this to the proper authorities .	1	['1']	1
I'm not resigning my senior partnership the day after what happened , happened , if that's what you're asking .	2	['2']	2
I never said monster .  	8, 2	['8', ' 2']	8
I'm having a birthday party Saturday .	2	['2']	2
We didn't have a mortgage .	6	['6']	6
To be hypnotized indirectly is very common , but to be regressed indirectly is not only unusual but a little nerve - wracking .	4	['4']	4
I didn't see him , but he hit me .	4	['4']	4
Somebody must be in good humour .	5	['5']	5
So , did you watch I Spy last night ?	2	['2']	2
I live only for revenge .	1	['1']	1
Wh ... what do you want me to do , pa ? Git another girl ?	4	['4']	4
Might as well be a hundred .	3, 4	['3', ' 4']	3
I swear to God , if I have to cut up another body for a potion .	1	['1']	1
You found her .	5, 7	['5', ' 7']	5
Any trouble , call on the phone .	4	['4']	4
I like your bat .	5	['5']	5
I'll tell you , two out of three of those judges do not use the internet .	1	['1']	1
What do you mean , call ?	7	['7']	7
Every time I think about it , I get sad and depressed , and I'm having flashbacks .	6	['6']	6
Do you see how this affects [PERSON] ? You don't ?	1	['1']	1
But what's that thing in my back pocket .	4	['4']	4
I'm really not sure .	6, 7	['6', ' 7']	6
You don't remember , do you ?	6, 7	['6', ' 7']	6
That would only make him less unhappy .	5	['5']	5
Because it didn't work .	1	['1']	1
That's a big surprise .	7	['7']	7
The Kid will have to play him .	2, 4	['2', ' 4']	2
Fuckin' wearin' me out .	6	['6']	6
John , really , I was only trying to help you out , that's all .	6	['6']	6
One time he had the whole cast over from some [LOCATION] show .	5	['5']	5
Don't let anybody tell you different .	8, 5	['8', ' 5']	8
Excuse me , but we've got a flight that's just about to leave .	4	['4']	4
But I always thought little stenographers made little pennies .	7	['7']	7
On the way home we did loop - the - loops so that I could see the moon upside down .	5	['5']	5
Now he'll be able to have everything he's always wanted and couldn't afford .	2	['2']	2
You'll stay here without food or water until you talk .	1	['1']	1
If you won't give it to me , I'll shoot .	1	['1']	1
What if we had dinner ? I give up .	8, 2	['8', ' 2']	8
Peace be upon you .	2	['2']	2
There was no way I could get in touch with my husband .	4	['4']	4
Why don't I do this right ?	6	['6']	6

I'm gonna force them into their room , grab their stuff , point the gun in their faces .	1, 2	['1', ' 2']	1
Do you wan na make love ?	2	['2']	2
Then stop calling me .	1, 3	['1', ' 3']	1
Miss [PERSON] , could I have a word with you in private ?	8	['8']	8
For the first time in my whole life , I know what I want to do .	5	['5']	5
If you let me stay with you , I'll tell you .	2	['2']	2
It's an amazing place . I really like coming here .	5	['5']	5
Stay out of sight .	1	['1']	1
Are you sure this report's correct ?	7	['7']	7
The helicopter crashed .	4, 6	['4', ' 6']	4
I am . I love you so much .	8, 5	['8', ' 5']	8
I would like to protest the counsel's twisting of words .	1, 3	['1', ' 3']	1
I'll call you as soon as I get there .	2	['2']	2
You sound like a woman with a mission . I am .	7	['7']	7
She must've struck something .	5	['5']	5
I didn't mean to offend you . I was just being me , you know ?	4, 6	['4', ' 6']	4
You'd think it was her own life she was fighting for .	2	['2']	2
Sometimes I think there's almost a chance for us .	5	['5']	5
I think it sucks . - What sucks .	1	['1']	1
Why is he driving ?	7	['7']	7
We have a lot of good connections in [LOCATION] .	5	['5']	5
[PERSON] , we've discovered something the human race has been searching for since the beginning of time .	5	['5']	5
You take half the troop and follow those that went to the east .	8	['8']	8
I want her out of here , Doctor .	3	['3']	3
Look at his crooked smile .	3	['3']	3
He lost all his patients , he didn't wan na go to the office .	6	['6']	6
We're in a war zone , [PERSON] : Two motorcycle officers horribly wounded in a crossfire , the police seemingly unable to rescue them in spite of several desperate , heroic attempts .	6	['6']	6
You little spying ' hyena . Did the professor put you up to this ?	1, 3, 4	['1', ' 3', ' 4']	1
But you can not help her .	6	['6']	6
What's the idea of turning her down ?	7	['7']	7
You're light again , [PERSON] .	2, 5, 7	['2', ' 5', ' 7']	2
How did you do that ?	7	['7']	7
What you readin' there , [LOCATION] ?	2	['2']	2
Listen , I've got something for you .	8	['8']	8
Well , I don't know . [PERSON] told me to bring it out this weekend so he can have a first look at it .	3	['3']	3
Stop biting your nails .	3	['3']	3
I'm beginning to like it .	2, 5	['2', ' 5']	2
He won't be bribed or threatened .	8	['8']	8
They came to help .	8	['8']	8
Well , I find in a moment of anger follows a thousand nights of sorrow .	6	['6']	6
Daddy , you found [PERSON] !	7	['7']	7
You couldn't have found anyone more sympathetic to your condition .	8	['8']	8
Maybe I ought to be a hero more often , huh ?	2	['2']	2
You wouldn't have come if you thought I was here .	6	['6']	6
Good job .	8, 5	['8', ' 5']	8
My sort of coming of age , which was hard ...	6	['6']	6
You're probably wondering why I'm here .	7	['7']	7
Then again , you never can tell .	7	['7']	7
As bad as it was having her missing , it was so traumatizing to hear these words coming from your - year - old child .	4, 6	['4', ' 6']	4
I'll kill you bitches !	1	['1']	1
Love thy neighbour .	8	['8']	8
Well , you're so much stronger than I am .	6	['6']	6
Haven't seen you for a while .	7	['7']	7
Let's finish with pretending .	1	['1']	1
To begin with , a thief .	3	['3']	3
This is so goddamn boring !	1	['1']	1
They're just animals , I guess .	3	['3']	3
Tell them to leave .	1, 2	['1', ' 2']	1
I'm sorry to have bothered you .	6	['6']	6
They're trying to take his old man's land .	3	['3']	3
But we've got to take a closer look at this big boy .	7	['7']	7
I made reservations at [LOCATION] on [LOCATION] .	2	['2']	2
You are the most incredible creature I've ever met .	5	['5']	5
Nothing more .	6	['6']	6
I fear the wrath of God .	4	['4']	4
Where are you from ?	2	['2']	2
What can we eat ?	2	['2']	2
Damn you !	1	['1']	1
She was very nervous when we left [LOCATION] .	6	['6']	6
Sorry , I should have mentioned it .	3, 6	['3', ' 6']	3
It wasn't even loaded .	7	['7']	7
You [PERSON] ?	2	['2']	2
Get out of my way , [PERSON] .	1	['1']	1
l don't want to hurt a cop .	4, 6	['4', ' 6']	4
Maybe they can take us .	2	['2']	2
l 'm in love with this baby that I'm carrying . 	8, 5	['8', ' 5']	8
It was just like old times .	5, 6	['5', ' 6']	5
Careful , brother .	4	['4']	4
Garter belt ?	7	['7']	7
Get off ! - Outside , please .	1	['1']	1
Don't tell me you've left it up there .	7	['7']	7
This thing that's killing your people and mine is from the other side .	4	['4']	4
It's impossible . [PERSON] ...	6, 7	['6', ' 7']	6
I want to drink a toast to you .	2	['2']	2
Don't anybody move !	4	['4']	4
Anyway you can't go to the hospital .	6, 7	['6', ' 7']	6
Your father wears tight underwear ! And I can't stand your mother ! Your father wears tight underwear !	1	['1']	1
I'm about to go get a slice right now .	2	['2']	2
My pleasure .	8, 5	['8', ' 5']	8
Will you shut up ?	1	['1']	1
That I will faithfully execute ...	8	['8']	8
I understand perfectly .	7	['7']	7
Yes ? What is it ?	1	['1']	1
Now I've really lost her .	6	['6']	6
Yeah ! Yeah ... Yes !	1, 5	['1', ' 5']	1
Oh , my god .	7	['7']	7
My pleasure , sir .	5	['5']	5
Said it was ghastly .	4	['4']	4
How can I undo the spell ?	4	['4']	4
Before you know it , we'll be good again .	5	['5']	5
[PERSON] , they weren't taking any chances !	3, 6, 7	['3', ' 6', ' 7']	3
Do we have a deal ?	8	['8']	8
We don't know much about anything , do we ?	7	['7']	7
You think I like playing sick little games with you ?	3	['3']	3
You really are trying to kill me , aren't you ?	4, 7	['4', ' 7']	4
Ruby's been dead for 14 , years .	6	['6']	6
He asked you not to get those records ?	1	['1']	1
I called and called . - Where were you last night ?	8, 1	['8', ' 1']	8
Some gang of cutthroats and murderers .	4	['4']	4
Someone's tampering with the security circuits .	4	['4']	4
That's a real woman .	5	['5']	5
Now put the wings on it .	8	['8']	8
She was a prisoner as I was , and he just heard that she's dead .	6	['6']	6
Let him go .	2, 4	['2', ' 4']	2
Well , we'd been scouting for what is called delicately a new face .  	2	['2']	2
I've never felt more alive in my whole life .	5	['5']	5
He's still emotionally unstable .	4	['4']	4
Why didn't you help me ?	1	['1']	1
I'm pretty sure I didn't kill anyone for it .	8	['8']	8
I hope I'm not obscure .	4	['4']	4
We'll work beautifully together .	5	['5']	5
As far as discretion goes , what were you and [PERSON] doing , comparing notes ?	7	['7']	7
[PERSON] knew he was taking bribes ?	1, 3, 7	['1', ' 3', ' 7']	1
Just take your meat and get out .	1	['1']	1
Well , I was wondering if you could hold something for me .	8	['8']	8
You know , I never did mind being around you , [PERSON] .	5	['5']	5
This report ? - No .	1, 2	['1', ' 2']	1
Hey , no !	4	['4']	4
Be quiet .	1	['1']	1
When do we start , mate ...	2	['2']	2
Well , I can not accuse you Of not making us comfortable , Captain .	8, 5	['8', ' 5']	8
Shall we bid our guests farewell ?	8	['8']	8
Don't you raise your voice to me !	1	['1']	1
After them ... slowly !	1, 2	['1', ' 2']	1
I need them yesterday .	1	['1']	1
Slow down , we lost [PERSON] !	1, 4	['1', ' 4']	1
Or you can go straight back to your home on the streets .	3	['3']	3
Tell them to get the hell out of there .	1	['1']	1
We can still make it .	8, 2, 7	['8', ' 2', ' 7']	8
Is he really our cousin ?	7	['7']	7
I know all the other teams laugh at me .	6	['6']	6
The A / V guy .	3	['3']	3
He kisses my hand .	5	['5']	5
Yes , but he went off without me , didn't he ?	1, 6	['1', ' 6']	1
Then they'll tell him the way to keep his boy from being hanged is to sign over his ranch to them for a quarter of what it's worth .	3	['3']	3
What are you good for ?	3	['3']	3
You're a fucking bastard !	3	['3']	3
We live in a wonderful life .	8, 5	['8', ' 5']	8
But I told you never to fight a street fighter fight .	3, 6	['3', ' 6']	3
He's a sneaky little shit just like you , right ?	3	['3']	3
This boy's honest , not stupid .	8	['8']	8
I don't care how you do it , but you find that desert rat .	3	['3']	3
Who was it ?	1	['1']	1
I can pull it out and let you take a whip _ if you'd like .	2	['2']	2
You will pay me back what you owe , with interest .	1, 2	['1', ' 2']	1
I was almost in tears .	6	['6']	6
I hope you like clowns .	1, 7	['1', ' 7']	1
What , it's over ?	6, 7	['6', ' 7']	6
Get the legs .	1, 2	['1', ' 2']	1
It's beyond me how the more money a corporation loses , the more it makes , because of the carryovers with the write - offs .	7	['7']	7
Nobody's gonna hurt you .	8	['8']	8
You're over .	1	['1']	1
Why did you take him then with me ?	1, 6, 7	['1', ' 6', ' 7']	1
What's going on , [PERSON] ?	4	['4']	4
That's wonderful !	5, 7	['5', ' 7']	5
What are you talkin' about ?	7	['7']	7
I'm sure you'll agree with me that it is my duty to become our leader .	8	['8']	8
There's a shitload of that .	7	['7']	7
Sit down , be comfortable .	8	['8']	8
These are strange times , my friend .	4	['4']	4
Coates , [PERSON] , take the first sentry duty .	8	['8']	8
My wife , God rest her soul , died years ago to the day .	6	['6']	6
Ace , king , .	5	['5']	5
That's what always happens when people fall in love .	6	['6']	6
I just got out of a drug clinic and you manipulate me ?	1, 3, 6	['1', ' 3', ' 6']	1
I'll wait for you upstairs .	2	['2']	2
You don't bring enough men with you .	4	['4']	4
That's incest !	3	['3']	3
I'm sure that's thanks to you as well .	5	['5']	5
Don't kid yourself .	1	['1']	1
No harm at all , mate .	5	['5']	5
Bye , Commander .	4, 6	['4', ' 6']	4
I just wanted to clear that up .	8	['8']	8
I can't stand it anymore .	6	['6']	6
What the hell am I living around here for ? 	1, 3, 6	['1', ' 3', ' 6']	1
You weren't on the team the last time we beat you .	7	['7']	7
And then he'll run our lives and take our money .	1, 4	['1', ' 4']	1
Come in out of the rain .	8	['8']	8
They're out there .	1, 4	['1', ' 4']	1
Oh , he didn't do it for you , [PERSON] .	1, 6	['1', ' 6']	1
You know , I think I'll start reviving that tomorrow .	2	['2']	2
Must you flirt ?	3	['3']	3
Nothing ever really dies in the House .	1	['1']	1
You ain't gonna have no crop because you got a sin on your soul .	3	['3']	3
Scatter and keep your mouths closed .	1	['1']	1
It provides us that delicious house over there .	2, 7	['2', ' 7']	2
Isn't that rather exposing the First Lady to some risk ?	4	['4']	4
Come on ! No , no , I don't want to go to the women's gymnasium .	3, 4, 6	['3', ' 4', ' 6']	3
Why ?	1, 2, 7	['1', ' 2', ' 7']	1
Maybe I can help you to get out of it .	8	['8']	8
I guess [PERSON] was about the prettiest , with all that long , yellow hair .	5	['5']	5
Did Captain [PERSON] look sick ?	4, 7	['4', ' 7']	4
A very mean hand .	2	['2']	2
No one else is heeding it .	6	['6']	6
I'd give you a kiss right now , but I'm afraid I'll ruin my makeup .	5	['5']	5
Shame on the people who put us in here !	1, 4	['1', ' 4']	1
Wait a minute . While you had what's - her - name sitting on your face ...	7	['7']	7
You're so beautiful .	5	['5']	5
It's terribly expensive here , [PERSON] .	3	['3']	3
Oscar , the phone !	1, 2	['1', ' 2']	1
You're just the cop I'm looking for .	8, 5	['8', ' 5']	8
I want to sit in front .	2	['2']	2
You know , I'm no doctor , but I could swear this youngster's inebriated .	3	['3']	3
Look , I better go !	2	['2']	2
Oh , [PERSON] would be mighty proud of you if you won yourself $ 25,000 .	2, 5	['2', ' 5']	2
The trouble with me ? I'm not very good at looking ahead .	6	['6']	6
They're blaming me for it .	6	['6']	6
You ought to be shown up .	1	['1']	1
So if you can just enjoy yourself with him like he's enjoying himself with you ....	2	['2']	2
This is my team .	8	['8']	8
More ! - More ?	7	['7']	7
Another funeral for the pilot , not as spiffy as [PERSON]'s .	6	['6']	6
That means we're in grave trouble .	4	['4']	4
All you need to know about the Trinity is this . God is like a shamrock !	5	['5']	5
He'll use everything in the book and then some he's made up to kill you .	4	['4']	4
Oh , thank God .	5	['5']	5
Could [PERSON]'s carriers do a reconnaissance job for us ?	2	['2']	2
Your opinion is that this was ... A staged rape ?	6, 7	['6', ' 7']	6
On !	2	['2']	2
I'm sorry , the coffee's gone .	6	['6']	6
Who the hell is that ?	1	['1']	1
Can't I go down to [LOCATION] and get it fixed ?	7	['7']	7
We are so proud of you . Do you get a discount ?	5	['5']	5
Where's the woman ? She's on the train .	2	['2']	2
Why don't you shut the hell up ! Crybaby .	1, 3	['1', ' 3']	1
Are you gonna shoot me ?	4	['4']	4
I hope so , sir .	2, 5	['2', ' 5']	2
Well , I really put my foot in my mouth this time but , I don't know , I like you two .	8, 3, 5	['8', ' 3', ' 5']	8
Good luck , Mom .	8, 2	['8', ' 2']	8
Clear ?	1	['1']	1
Boy , you got hands of gold .	8, 7	['8', ' 7']	8
We have an emergency .	4	['4']	4
When we return , we're getting married .	2	['2']	2
You don't seem very excited about it .	6	['6']	6
You're right , [PERSON] .	8	['8']	8
Oh , professor ... just a moment .	7	['7']	7
The feces has struck the air conditioner .	3	['3']	3
You're the only one with the experience . No , [PERSON] , I do not have the strength .	8, 1, 6	['8', ' 1', ' 6']	8
Take me with you !	8	['8']	8
If you start to hesitate , call me .	2, 5	['2', ' 5']	2
Jesus . Yes , this is me .	8, 2	['8', ' 2']	8
Enough to spread you out like a crazy woman's quilt .	3	['3']	3
It'd be a big help if you could keep an area clear in front of the bridge for us .	8	['8']	8
Uh , b - bullets for some , and f - fire for others .	4	['4']	4
What should I be afraid ?	4, 7	['4', ' 7']	4
Oh , monkey . - ( laughs )	5	['5']	5
Fucking asshole . I love you .	8, 5	['8', ' 5']	8
How do you play stud , [PERSON] ?	2	['2']	2
I swear to God .	8	['8']	8
We're the only two people in the world that know , Maxim , you and I.	8	['8']	8
What are you wearing my coat for ?	2, 7	['2', ' 7']	2
Better you than your mother .	3	['3']	3
But , they might be ready to make a go of it on their own .	8, 2, 5	['8', ' 2', ' 5']	8
You don't know from one day to the next ... whether you're going to be killed , go home , or get busted .	4	['4']	4
And there's not a damn thing you can do about it , you understand me ?	1, 6	['1', ' 6']	1
But everyone pretended he could walk ?	7	['7']	7
And think of her - if she knows nothing , she's safe .	5	['5']	5
Come give your grandfather a hug .	8, 5	['8', ' 5']	8
Turns out my life hasn't been my own for the last years .	6	['6']	6
He might even put in bleachers . Oh , yeah !	2, 5	['2', ' 5']	2
There were no other documents ? - I got everything in the room .	2, 4	['2', ' 4']	2
Are you really that quiet ?	3	['3']	3
He looks like a drunk .	3	['3']	3
Everybody's a screwball in some way .	2, 3, 5, 6, 8	['2', ' 3', ' 5', ' 6', ' 8']	2
I have to take a bus .	1	['1']	1
Outstanding !	7	['7']	7
I got something here that belongs to you .	8	['8']	8
There's just this one hammer .	1	['1']	1
Soon you'll even forget that your last name is Chow	1	['1']	1
But if I don't hear from you in a week , me and [PERSON] are going to disappear .	8, 4	['8', ' 4']	8
Pretty good chow .	5	['5']	5
I think Mr [PERSON] is disturbed because he can't take you to the party and dance all over your feet .	3	['3']	3
Nice family you got here .	5	['5']	5
[PERSON] , the funniest champion ever .	5	['5']	5
Fantastic .	5	['5']	5
That's good . He's bringing his grandson . He's grooming him to take over .	8, 2, 5	['8', ' 2', ' 5']	8
I can't believe it was you on the phone .	7	['7']	7
Something about your mother .	7	['7']	7
They wouldn't let you take your dog ?	7	['7']	7
There you go .	8, 5	['8', ' 5']	8
No , not today .	1, 3	['1', ' 3']	1
[PERSON] . [PERSON] , what happened ?	4	['4']	4
How can you be so inhuman ?	3	['3']	3
He suffered me to buy him a new suit ... and to get him a job at his old hospital .	7	['7']	7
Be careful , you'll put my cigar out .	4	['4']	4
And that's all I can give you .	6	['6']	6
I want you to look after me .	8	['8']	8
There's my favourite little boy .	8, 5	['8', ' 5']	8
She told about a mother who was full of hate , and how she got back the hate she gave .	6	['6']	6
And [PERSON] was trying to kill him .	4	['4']	4
My bet says no other rider in the race will beat mine .	5	['5']	5
A guy like me should never be allowed to get in here in the first place !	6	['6']	6
Do not worry , he does not know anything .	8, 1	['8', ' 1']	8
They're going to choose you . I just know it .	2, 3, 5	['2', ' 3', ' 5']	2
Calm down , chica . She only owes me more .	7	['7']	7
You love her or what ?	7	['7']	7
And now they've lost it .	1, 5, 6	['1', ' 5', ' 6']	1
Don't talk rot , [PERSON] .	3	['3']	3
It'll be lovely .	2	['2']	2
They got away .	6	['6']	6
Oh , boy , is this great !	5	['5']	5
You are dead inside .	3	['3']	3
Ma'am , she's no longer a minor . There's nothing we can do . But , but , but .	6	['6']	6
Elder , if you have something to say , just say it	1	['1']	1
Now , they were mostly destroyed , but I was able to recover data from one of them .	2, 5, 7	['2', ' 5', ' 7']	2
Boys forget what their country means by just reading  Land of the Free  in history books .	6	['6']	6
Why do you think there's been no fighting in [PERSON] or [PERSON] ?	2	['2']	2
I hated to do anything that might get you into trouble .	6	['6']	6
But then , I wouldn't have had a chance to thank you .	2	['2']	2
You took her from my house last night !	1	['1']	1
The old man was right after all !	7	['7']	7
I've , uh , really enjoyed this little chat .	4	['4']	4
It feels wonderful !	5	['5']	5
May he rest in peace .	6	['6']	6
All I know is that I'd like to meet a member of the judiciary or a member of Congress that thinks that this situation , the status quo is satisfactory .	1, 3	['1', ' 3']	1
You wouldn't close him down if you were [PERSON] , would you ?	7	['7']	7
You'll see the women in [LOCATION] . They're the most beautiful in the world .	2, 5	['2', ' 5']	2
Where's the lady ?	2	['2']	2
I'll protect you .	8	['8']	8
If you want to cite law , then obey it yourself .	1, 3	['1', ' 3']	1
Opening night never starts on time .	6, 7	['6', ' 7']	6
I'm gonna ride on back and keep watch .	8	['8']	8
Here we go again !	2, 5	['2', ' 5']	2
If you need me , just pull this .	8	['8']	8
Congratulations .	8, 5	['8', ' 5']	8
Father , I've led such a sinful life .	4	['4']	4
You wanted big ... real big .	2	['2']	2
You make me sick when you speak , [PERSON] .	3	['3']	3
We expect the best from you .	2	['2']	2
Most of the young hotshots were lining up for Robbery or Homicide .	5	['5']	5
It's hard being a dope fiend .	6	['6']	6
After marrying , clear what ...	3	['3']	3
This is my first night being a dad .	2, 4, 5	['2', ' 4', ' 5']	2
No , I would be beholden .	2	['2']	2
I had to make the same decision you were asked to make today .	8	['8']	8
( Coughing ) Do you know you're out of your mind ?	8, 4, 7	['8', ' 4', ' 7']	8
Unless he's looking for something else .	7	['7']	7
I'm just tired .	1, 3, 6	['1', ' 3', ' 6']	1
As if all my life I had lived in a dark place , and all at once the lights went on .	5	['5']	5
Besides , she's new .	8	['8']	8
I hardly think you're in a position to judge me .	1	['1']	1
Where's the chief , ? Do not get smart with me !	1	['1']	1
You're good , but you're taking on a lot .	6	['6']	6
I'm not interested in your opinion .	1	['1']	1
Nice to meet you .	5	['5']	5
Your mom's not a giver - upper .	8	['8']	8
Defend yourselves !	1, 4, 7	['1', ' 4', ' 7']	1
We're not going to kick anyone out .	8	['8']	8

I thought it was a good speech .	5, 6	['5', ' 6']	5
If we had known , we would have greeted you with flowers .	6	['6']	6
She's lovely .	8, 5	['8', ' 5']	8

Oh , sure . They have a terrific dental plan . But that wasn't why .	8	['8']	8
When [PERSON] died , [PERSON] was only five .	6	['6']	6
That is some horse .	7	['7']	7

You're sure of that , are you ?	7	['7']	7
Look what I found .	5	['5']	5
Because of your colonel's stubbornness we are far behind schedule .	1	['1']	1
He ran over [LOCATION] like you'd run over a dog and never bothered to stop his car .	3	['3']	3
Yes , everybody . Very good .	5	['5']	5
I'm sick and tired of hearing about him .	3	['3']	3
Is it that you think it'll be better for ... for all of us if you go away ?	6	['6']	6

Tell me publishing dates . 	2	['2']	2
I wish you could spend some time with him .	6	['6']	6
If we push this , who are we pushing against ?	2, 4	['2', ' 4']	2

We're on vacation .	5	['5']	5
Looks like we're going that way .	7	['7']	7
Try me .	8, 1, 2	['8', ' 1', ' 2']	8
Every word that boy said about [PERSON] and me and graft and the rotten political corruption of my state is true !	8	['8']	8

I'll make amends .	8, 2, 4, 6	['8', ' 2', ' 4', ' 6']	8
Exactly how inexpensive ?	7	['7']	7
As if he isn't going to be hurt enough , she has to twist a knife in him too .	3	['3']	3

And I cried the whole time .	6	['6']	6
Behind this eloquent exterior , I've got a yellow streak miles wide .	6	['6']	6

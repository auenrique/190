No ! - Morning hugs ?	8, 1	['8', ' 1']	8
% ? !	7	['7']	7
You sound like a rug salesman .	8, 3, 5	['8', ' 3', ' 5']	8
Amen ! Amen !	5	['5']	5
So what happened between you two , then ?	2	['2']	2
How about some more mint juice ?	2	['2']	2
First , let's find them .	2	['2']	2
Let's tell ghost stories .	2	['2']	2
That the best you can do ?	1, 3	['1', ' 3']	1
Who is she ?	7	['7']	7
You hurt me . Yes .	1, 3, 6	['1', ' 3', ' 6']	1
Here it comes .	2	['2']	2
Look at what you've done .	1	['1']	1
It looks very nice on you .	5	['5']	5
What's the matter , [PERSON] ?	4	['4']	4
I want everything he's got .	2	['2']	2
That's confusing the issue .	7	['7']	7
By the way , here's something that'll interest you .	2	['2']	2
Remember my th birthday party when you lifted your skirt up ...	5	['5']	5
That's brilliant . [PERSON] .	8, 2, 5	['8', ' 2', ' 5']	8
Well , I'll fly down to [LOCATION] in the morning and feel them out .	2	['2']	2
That's when they start to drift away .	6	['6']	6
Use my car . Great .	1, 5	['1', ' 5']	1
You were incredible today .	8, 5, 7	['8', ' 5', ' 7']	8
So much fun and imagination .	5	['5']	5
I've missed so much !	6	['6']	6
[PERSON] , turn me in if you want to . But this is over the line .	1	['1']	1
Men will believe anything , the more preposterous the better .	3	['3']	3
But don't look so gloomy .	6	['6']	6
He took her to a restaurant . Maybe some food would make her feel better .	2, 5	['2', ' 5']	2
I - I'm in here .	4	['4']	4
Honey , please don't stand like that .	1	['1']	1
You look different .	7	['7']	7
I don't want to sound like a Debbie the [PERSON] , but no matter how many times you come up against the Communications Decency Act it's always gonna shut you down .	6	['6']	6
It's ... unselfish love .	2, 5	['2', ' 5']	2
Brought about by what is know as  the miracle of love  .	5	['5']	5
You need not be afraid .	8	['8']	8
Gone .	6	['6']	6
You deserve a nice , clean place .	8	['8']	8
I got a run of three .	5	['5']	5
This time , you won't get away with it .	1, 2	['1', ' 2']	1
An ongoing retainer on a claiming horse ... that makes tremendous sense . My money , kid ... that's a kiss - off for getting bumped .	5	['5']	5
Can I get you a drink ?	2	['2']	2
What do you hope to accomplish ?	1	['1']	1
Somebody ought to stay with [PERSON] and Pa.	8	['8']	8
Promise me one thing .	8	['8']	8
Yes , I'm talking about honour , not ideology .	1	['1']	1
Sweetie , you get the pleasure .	5	['5']	5
I said it , damn you .	1	['1']	1
No , I just thought we could spend the day together .	6	['6']	6
You're not tired .	8	['8']	8
You guys are so sweet , you know that ?	5	['5']	5
I don't believe it ! He was down and out and finished !	7	['7']	7
You're getting out .	7	['7']	7
It seems that we are forced to admit that our suspicions are wrong , despite her confession .	1, 3	['1', ' 3']	1
You earned a piece of it .	8	['8']	8
I didn't give orders for a halt .	1	['1']	1
Handy little thing , isn't it ?	5	['5']	5
So , I'm here .	8, 5	['8', ' 5']	8
Take your hands off me !	1	['1']	1
Is it supposed to work right away ?	7	['7']	7
I command thy putrid spirit Be banished from this child's soul .	1	['1']	1
I think I'll take a nice dose of sleeping pills tonight .	6	['6']	6
And lo and behold , we get through all of it ... the jackpot , the horse , this headcase [PERSON] , and here's this horse , ready to run .	8, 2	['8', ' 2']	8
Take me out . Help me !	4	['4']	4
Breathe normally , And ease out slowly . Ready ?	4	['4']	4
Nobody's gonna make me do that !	1	['1']	1
Probably I'm prejudiced , but it seems to me that [PERSON] is a pretty cute young lady .	5	['5']	5
She'd come back , soaked to the skin , but always with the same excuse :	8, 1	['8', ' 1']	8
You won't get my approval on this .	1, 3	['1', ' 3']	1
Oh , this place is such a mess .	3	['3']	3
Blowing them up .	1, 4	['1', ' 4']	1
Don't call me .	1	['1']	1
Even in one of yours , I would have thrown this glass at him .	1	['1']	1
Can -- I was gonna ask you if I could give it to you ?	6	['6']	6
It's such a pleasant little place .	5	['5']	5
But I'll meet you at the [LOCATION] movie theatre .	2	['2']	2
You don't know how much satisfaction it's been to me .	5	['5']	5
Allow me to get that bag for you .	2, 7	['2', ' 7']	2
You would've been tough . Very tough .	8	['8']	8
And I trust you .	8	['8']	8
Nothing will ever happen to me anymore !	5	['5']	5
Jesus Christ .	4, 7	['4', ' 7']	4
This licence has expired .	6, 7	['6', ' 7']	6
We mean it , sir , all kiddin' aside .	8, 2, 5, 7	['8', ' 2', ' 5', ' 7']	8
I'm ... I'm sorry .	6	['6']	6
Take it off !	1, 3, 4	['1', ' 3', ' 4']	1
I'm in bad shape .	6	['6']	6
Somebody ought to get their ass kicked for this mess .	3	['3']	3
I just spoke to [PERSON] .	5	['5']	5
Hey ... at least you never got involved with her .	2	['2']	2
Come clean right now . Uh ...	4	['4']	4
We never miss .	8	['8']	8
Holy [PERSON] .	7	['7']	7
Sit down there .	8	['8']	8
Of course , but we are only telling you because we know you'll want to rescue him .	2, 4	['2', ' 4']	2
Perfect camouflage .	5	['5']	5
[LOCATION] , I've got to move some cars ,	2	['2']	2
He got run over by a car .	6	['6']	6
As I step into the rat catcher , the first thing I notice , besides the smell of rancid beer and stale piss , is the tension .	3	['3']	3
I think my cook has managed guess what I like .	8, 5, 7	['8', ' 5', ' 7']	8
I'd rather die .	1, 3, 6	['1', ' 3', ' 6']	1
Will you promise ?	8	['8']	8
I'm gonna do it alone !	8, 1	['8', ' 1']	8
But you make one slip , just one and we'll see how long you survive in my cage .	1, 2	['1', ' 2']	1
I know bad that this mission cause you grief , lady . Is of great importance for our country .	8, 2, 3, 6	['8', ' 2', ' 3', ' 6']	8
I might be able to accommodate you .	8	['8']	8
Would they mock him ?	4, 6, 7	['4', ' 6', ' 7']	4
I mean , all you have to do is to step aside with immense fortune .	8	['8']	8
Nobody comes , nobody pays any attention .	6	['6']	6
Oh , shit !	4	['4']	4
Reluctantly , I may add .	1	['1']	1
I'm drunker than you are , so it'll be a fair fight .	1	['1']	1
June , your dog just upchucked .	3	['3']	3
I can see that !	7	['7']	7
Will you go along with their agenda ?	2	['2']	2
It's a shame to waste all that prime beef on a guy serving three to five in prison .	3	['3']	3
There is a question as to what kind of society we're going to be , whether we're going to tolerate sexual trafficking in children .	4, 6	['4', ' 6']	4
You come to a crime scene , you don't know who to shoot .	1, 2, 4, 7	['1', ' 2', ' 4', ' 7']	1
I'm feeling fine this morning .	5	['5']	5
Me not work ?	7	['7']	7
To find out whether you're a gambler or a trainer .	2, 7	['2', ' 7']	2
We're going to do everything we can to help you , but you've got to help , too .	8	['8']	8
It's as corrupt as [LOCATION] , but ... there's less bullshit .	8	['8']	8
You worked with [PERSON] , [PERSON] and them guys .	8, 5	['8', ' 5']	8
But it's happening !	2	['2']	2
Did you hear me ?	1	['1']	1
Such spirit ! Catch me if you can !	1	['1']	1
I'm unhappy .	6	['6']	6
Now she's going back today , soon as we give 'em a full stomach to travel on .	5	['5']	5
You're not married ?	7	['7']	7
He's great if you happen to like a tall , blond , Prussian , Nordic , Aryan , Nazi type .	3	['3']	3
What could possibly be the matter ?	1	['1']	1
You really and truly are a perfect bastard .	3	['3']	3
Casualty report ?	6	['6']	6
Any more than I could on that night I saw [PERSON] for the last time .	6	['6']	6
She's a beautiful tough cookie .	5	['5']	5
And if there was , I sure as hell wouldn't tell you , colonel .	1	['1']	1
Stop .	1	['1']	1
That's right , $ , .	7	['7']	7
Perhaps you could enlighten the jury as to what else the government's giving you in exchange for this testimony .	8, 4	['8', ' 4']	8
You're wasting your time with me . I'm nothing .	6	['6']	6
I don't want my picture taken .	1	['1']	1
I'm going to college but hoping to do volunteer work in the summer .	2	['2']	2
God , it's in perfect shape .	5	['5']	5
You might be an interesting subject of study .	2	['2']	2
I - I came to this country to pursue the American dream .	4	['4']	4
Don't try to tell me my business .	1	['1']	1
[PERSON] , are we leaving ?	7	['7']	7
A hundred years from now , nobody will know the difference .	2	['2']	2
Who are you ?	1, 3	['1', ' 3']	1
The only place my parents ever mentioned coming from was overseas .	6	['6']	6
Keep your voice down !	1	['1']	1
This is a merchant ship . We're carrying machine parts .	2, 5	['2', ' 5']	2
Is it real ? Is it real pig ?	7	['7']	7
I'm a friend of the family .	8	['8']	8
I shall dance , and you'll be with me .	5	['5']	5
They'll get me tonight , for sure .	4	['4']	4
You got it ? - Yeah , I think so .	8	['8']	8
[PERSON] was good to me .	8	['8']	8
Let's belly up to the bar and get us some refreshment .	2	['2']	2
No , for [PERSON] and [PERSON] .	6, 7	['6', ' 7']	6
Your Highness slept well ?	8, 2, 5	['8', ' 2', ' 5']	8
It's superficial .	3	['3']	3
Anybody would be ashamed of that .	3	['3']	3
Do people think I'm a carbon copy or a second - rate pretender who only got a shot because of my skin tone ?  	1, 4	['1', ' 4']	1
Anyhow , I'm sick a human life was lost .	1	['1']	1
What a gruesome proof of the power of the press .	3	['3']	3
Then what did you just stuff under your bed ? Nothing .	4	['4']	4
Isn't [PERSON]'s death enough ?	4	['4']	4
You could have alerted us !	1	['1']	1
I'm not scared really .	8	['8']	8
You're scaring me .	4	['4']	4
Bad dog !	3	['3']	3
I have a terrible feeling he cut off my head .	4	['4']	4
The only thing you'll get from me is this .	1	['1']	1
Perfect for a single man living alone .	5	['5']	5
I can't tell you what a welcome sight this is .	5	['5']	5
In the garden of a convent in [LOCATION] , there's a beautiful statue .	5	['5']	5
And that's why I don't wan na talk about it if I don't have to .	1	['1']	1
Halt !	1, 2	['1', ' 2']	1
He was ... fine .	3	['3']	3
I've seen him !	7	['7']	7
Do you feel better now that you're eating ?	2	['2']	2
Well , I don't give a damn about the reason .	1	['1']	1
I might do that .	8, 7	['8', ' 7']	8
They're so nice to have .	5	['5']	5
When that bomb blows , we'll lose our oxygen fast .	4	['4']	4
How are you feeling ?	8	['8']	8
Nice party .	5	['5']	5
Why can't this guy stay on the ground ?	1	['1']	1

But the neighbours will know we've adopted .	4, 7	['4', ' 7']	4
Come to [LOCATION] .	2	['2']	2
Where's all the money today ?	7	['7']	7
Not the gondola , not the gondola .	4	['4']	4
Well , I'm not people .	1, 3	['1', ' 3']	1
Rocky , I'm sorry .	6	['6']	6
Actually , we don't know a soul here .	7	['7']	7
That's how it looks in my report unless you've got something to change it .	1	['1']	1
Very funny .	5	['5']	5
You know , you - you could get hurt . You shouldn't go around robbing people . You could go to jail .	1, 3, 4, 6	['1', ' 3', ' 4', ' 6']	1
And yet with all that ... they still want to try it again ?	4	['4']	4
Forgive me .	6	['6']	6
Switch over !	4	['4']	4
You want me to tail him ?	2	['2']	2
Please just look at me .	2, 6	['2', ' 6']	2
No one picked on you , [PERSON] .	1	['1']	1
The margin for error is narrow here .	8	['8']	8
You steal a little swordfish , and [PERSON] should lighten up ?	7	['7']	7
Don't make me feel like this .	6	['6']	6
Running up stairs keeps my legs slim .	5	['5']	5
Let's see if he's ticklish .	2	['2']	2
It couldn't have been me , sir .	4	['4']	4
And I'll get a good price .	5	['5']	5
There's not much we can do .	6	['6']	6
Drink to the winner !	5	['5']	5

Honey , dinner will be ready in about 30 , minutes .	2	['2']	2
[PERSON] looked cute .	5	['5']	5
He does do right well for himself .	8	['8']	8
Last time I saw him , he threw up scrambled eggs out of his nose on the way to the library .	6	['6']	6
Who says ?	3	['3']	3
You don't have to protect me .	8	['8']	8
This is all a cover - up .	3	['3']	3
Witness interviews ?	7	['7']	7
You haven't had the big payday yet .	2, 5	['2', ' 5']	2
I'm not doing it alone .	4, 6, 7	['4', ' 6', ' 7']	4
Tough guys who didn't crack up like [PERSON] .	8	['8']	8
I know exactly the situation I'm in .	1	['1']	1
Congressman [PERSON] is minutes late as usual .	1	['1']	1
I need something something that can fly and that can scare the pants off anything living in that castle .	8, 2	['8', ' 2']	8
What do you mean , no ? You callin' me a liar ?	1	['1']	1
Well , why didn't I know about that ?	1	['1']	1
I killed her .	6	['6']	6
With her , it would be marriage or nothing , and that's out of the question .	1	['1']	1
Concentrating on a few pieces of onerous legislation is not a plan .	3	['3']	3
We are witnessing the making of a legend , [PERSON] , the kind of thing that front covers are made of .	8, 2, 5	['8', ' 2', ' 5']	8
Now get the smile off your face .	1	['1']	1
I'm going to see my mother before she dies ... in [LOCATION] .	2, 4, 5	['2', ' 4', ' 5']	2
Please , hurry , this man is really ill .	4	['4']	4
Helping me . This isn't helpful .	1	['1']	1
Did you really think he would come with you ?	1, 2, 7	['1', ' 2', ' 7']	1
Both those guys on the trailer are in it .	3, 4	['3', ' 4']	3
They took her .	1, 4	['1', ' 4']	1
Child , crying :	6	['6']	6
And given your background , I'm sure you can figure it out .	8, 3	['8', ' 3']	8
It's just beginner's luck .	1, 6, 7	['1', ' 6', ' 7']	1
Don't tell me that you're above temptation .	1	['1']	1
If you ever talk to me like that again ... I'll make sure you never win another election in your life .	3	['3']	3
Oh , wait .	2	['2']	2
I'll earn enough money to get us to [LOCATION] .	2	['2']	2
Maybe it'll take a few months , maybe a year .	2	['2']	2
It's a whole new deal .	7	['7']	7
I'd like to say hi to all the guys down at work .	2	['2']	2
Queeg endangered the lives of the men .	4	['4']	4
And if you want something sugar - coated , I'll order you dessert .	2, 5	['2', ' 5']	2
When Mr [PERSON]'s feet hurt , he drives the whole house crazy .	1	['1']	1
That meteor is either very light , which is unheard of , or it's hollow .	7	['7']	7
Help me !	8, 4, 7	['8', ' 4', ' 7']	8
I know what these jerks are like .	8, 1, 3	['8', ' 1', ' 3']	8
What the hell is the matter with you ?	1, 3	['1', ' 3']	1
I can't agree to the terms without the approval of my State Councillor for Foreign Affairs .	4	['4']	4
We are happy to take this opportunity ...	5	['5']	5
Maybe you can talk this over later in private , maybe .	4	['4']	4
I asked you to dance three times and you didn't wan na .	6	['6']	6
But do you truly believe that by deliberate present - day action we can neutralize that possibility and alter the future ?	7	['7']	7
Where'd you get that ?	2	['2']	2
Let's have a good game .	2	['2']	2
It must be a mistake , he was clever ...	6, 7	['6', ' 7']	6
I have to get out of here . or what's left of my family is going to die .	4	['4']	4
You did . - Come on .	5	['5']	5
[PERSON] , can you hear me ?	4	['4']	4
Soothing .	5	['5']	5
Yes . - Well , this is an emergency !	4	['4']	4
[PERSON] , do you know what you did ?	3	['3']	3
They'll beg us to let them in .	1	['1']	1
You're in no particular danger , I think .	8	['8']	8
Yeah , mind your own business .	1	['1']	1
You go home . I'll handle the captain .	8	['8']	8
Careful of my vitals .	4	['4']	4
Ten percent of your action be enough for anyone .	8	['8']	8
I want to go .	4, 6	['4', ' 6']	4
Mr. [PERSON] , the man is honest . I can trust you .	2, 5	['2', ' 5']	2
Howdy's got worms .	3, 6	['3', ' 6']	3
What do I have to do ? Grow up .	1	['1']	1
Plain and simple .	8, 5	['8', ' 5']	8
Why on earth did she come here ?	7	['7']	7
Get me some punch .	2	['2']	2

People , this'll be picture !	2	['2']	2
Pretty dress .	5	['5']	5
Gold !	2, 5, 7	['2', ' 5', ' 7']	2
Remember the Herefords in [LOCATION] ?	2, 5	['2', ' 5']	2
Father , what's going on here ?	7	['7']	7
I was crazy with jealousy .	6	['6']	6
We don't belong here .	6	['6']	6
♪ The bright blessed day ♪	5	['5']	5
Just take a breath .	8	['8']	8
They must have been tracking her or waiting for her to show up .	3, 4	['3', ' 4']	3
And there's the black hand that did the dirty deed .	3	['3']	3
Yeah , we know the place .	8	['8']	8
You don't want us to drink ourselves to sleep .	6	['6']	6
Who are they ?	2	['2']	2
Get in touch with them . Meet us at the border .	2	['2']	2
We can't feed the Russian people on your intentions .	1	['1']	1
Fine .	1, 5	['1', ' 5']	1
Sounds tough .	6	['6']	6
Hanford has extensive outdoor experience .	8	['8']	8

These men .	3	['3']	3
Now we are running out of ammunition .	4	['4']	4
Deal them up , Shooter .	2	['2']	2
That's a shame , isn't it ?	1, 6	['1', ' 6']	1
How do you expect to enjoy your honeymoon if you can't relax ?	1	['1']	1
But he knew I was lying .	4	['4']	4
I've been building a reputation for 25 , years .	5	['5']	5
cause if you take two big bites and just swallow it , It could get stuck in your throat .	1	['1']	1
It cheered me up infinitamente .	5	['5']	5
If you don't , somebody else will .	1, 7	['1', ' 7']	1
No , I stay with you .	8	['8']	8
I love soothing a man .	5	['5']	5
I can't tell you that !	1	['1']	1
I had got addicted to watching porn .	3, 6	['3', ' 6']	3
Now what makes you think I hate her ?	7	['7']	7
What else ?	2	['2']	2
It's cold .	3, 6	['3', ' 6']	3
Anybody could be wrong .	4	['4']	4
It can't be a coincidence it lays out this way , [PERSON] .	4	['4']	4
Code red , code red !	4	['4']	4
You'd want your mommy too , if you had to say all this . - Cut !	1	['1']	1
It's also possible to look at this in , really , just a slightly different way , which is just as sad , maybe even sadder .	6	['6']	6
It felt like an earthquake .	4	['4']	4
Speaking of which , what can I get you ?	2	['2']	2
He's dead , isn't he ?	4, 6	['4', ' 6']	4
I told you not to come into the lobby .	1	['1']	1

You and the boys take care of him .	8	['8']	8
It's like working in a filling station , watching the cars go by .	3, 6	['3', ' 6']	3

How about two foursomes of golf , huh ?	2	['2']	2
I was free .	5	['5']	5
You got that ?	1	['1']	1

Want to see a strange object ?	2	['2']	2
I feel useless because I was born without it .	6	['6']	6
Well , screw the British .	1, 3	['1', ' 3']	1
It's like they're running an errand , and they happen to spot the one they love across the street running a different errand .	7	['7']	7
Everyone wanted to do the oral argument , that's always kind of the cherry on top of the ice cream there .	5, 7	['5', ' 7']	5
Down with the King .	1, 3	['1', ' 3']	1
I don't know . We just ... became friends . And then it became more than that .	8, 5	['8', ' 5']	8

It is so wonderful to meet the uncle of darling little Junior .	5	['5']	5

A [PERSON] saved my life . I just wanted to buy 'em a beer to thank 'em .	8, 2	['8', ' 2']	8
I certainly don't consciously realise it , and I think that's pretty rotten of you to say that .	3	['3']	3
Maybe you should've told her you loved her . Maybe that was the way to make sure .	6	['6']	6
We're going to open !	2	['2']	2
Who dares to ....	1	['1']	1
Set us free !	1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6	['1', ' 2', ' 3', ' 4', ' 5', ' 6']	1

Oh ... innocence can be hell .	1	['1']	1
I am sure you will find her in the fraternity house .	3	['3']	3
Everybody that comes to [LOCATION] got a dream .	8, 2, 5	['8', ' 2', ' 5']	8
I want those two guys banished from her life .	1	['1']	1

Ladies and gentlemen with great pleasure I give you Robocop .	5	['5']	5
Listen , if things don't work out , you can get in touch with me in [LOCATION] .	8	['8']	8
To cover it up .	7	['7']	7

I'd like you to stay at my house .	8	['8']	8
I've seen men rape an old crippled woman in a wet ditch .	3	['3']	3

Then ask him who ordered that each man should catch flies a day . And that they should be collected , counted and delivered daily , by me .	1, 2, 3	['1', ' 2', ' 3']	1
You think you'd like to try that before you eat ?	2	['2']	2
I don't expect nothing . I'm nonchalant .	8, 4	['8', ' 4']	8
Then why are you hanging around here ?	7	['7']	7
You said it's never been done in the history of the DA's office .	2	['2']	2
My sweetheart gave it to me .	5	['5']	5
You're both so complicated .	3	['3']	3
Do your best to keep him there until our men come along .	8	['8']	8

Stay out of it .	1	['1']	1
Anyway , we're late for school .	1, 2	['1', ' 2']	1
Do not think that I do not agree with everything you say , [PERSON] , but I. . .	1, 4, 6, 7	['1', ' 4', ' 6', ' 7']	1
We've come to wish you joy .	5	['5']	5
If you ask you're going to get an absolute no .	1	['1']	1
It wouldn't have worked .	6	['6']	6
I've forgotten how good a bad woman feels .	5	['5']	5
We went back to square one .	3	['3']	3
So you're behind all this .	7	['7']	7

How do you know I wouldn't miss it ?	2	['2']	2
Wan na hear what I wrote about you ?	2	['2']	2
He'll leave and take the little brat with him .	1	['1']	1
There were four , uh , aliens aboard I think .	4	['4']	4
You might choose your company with better taste .	3	['3']	3
I'm tired of this baby crap !	3	['3']	3
But they were lights , they were flying around .	7	['7']	7
What do you mean by that ?	7	['7']	7
Six months ago , who'd have thought we'd be spending Christmas together ?	7	['7']	7
We had the kind of relationship where we laughed and laughed and laughed all the time .	5	['5']	5
Do you have a gun ?	2	['2']	2
This is a surprise .	7	['7']	7
Shouldn't we be going ?	1	['1']	1
You should have thought of that before you left the house .	1	['1']	1
One look from the head of [LOCATION] can turn all creatures into stone .	4	['4']	4
I know you'll take good care of it .	8	['8']	8
How did you pull that ? What do you got ...	7	['7']	7
I really am in a hurry .	4	['4']	4
Did Mr. [PERSON] call anybody in the room by name ?	2	['2']	2

Are you in tonight ?	2	['2']	2
The damn insurance company won't cover you without a screen . I see .	1, 3	['1', ' 3']	1
He was completely misquoted .	1	['1']	1
I'd rather take a whipping than mend fences .	6	['6']	6
It's your responsibility to be here for us !	1	['1']	1
You protect a fruit stand , man , a shoeshine parlor , you know ?	7	['7']	7
Yeah , call the cops .	1	['1']	1
And when I'm dead on the altar of my country , I hope your conscience irks you .	3	['3']	3
Not until you've finished .	6, 7	['6', ' 7']	6
We're going home .	2	['2']	2

I'm tired .	2, 6	['2', ' 6']	2
No . Wait .	2	['2']	2
So you're going to report sister [PERSON] to the police ?	4	['4']	4
You've caused enough trouble .	1	['1']	1
Now , I happen to know of a prick that's responsible for the whole fucking operation and that son of bitch is hurting out there , and I'm fucking liking it .	1, 3, 5	['1', ' 3', ' 5']	1
Only holy people may enter this sacred place . Stay where you are	6	['6']	6
We've simply got to convince you that you're going to serve the right cause .	8	['8']	8
I mean , I want to work in media .	2	['2']	2
The man you love more than anyone is inside the church waiting for you .	5	['5']	5

Ladies and gentlemen , the famous [PERSON] has gladly consented to sing a few songs for us tonight .	2	['2']	2
Don't worry about me .	5	['5']	5
How ya doin' ?	2	['2']	2
It's gonna be a treacherous hike .	2, 4	['2', ' 4']	2
Unfortunately for you and everybody in this room , his deals fell through because the market dried up .	6	['6']	6
He was my only boy , and I love him so much .	8, 5, 6	['8', ' 5', ' 6']	8
Is too much heat almost , it is not ?	3	['3']	3
We need you to know what work we'll give you .	8	['8']	8

In a shootout , five members of one Colombian drug gang were ambushed by their bloody rivals , the Jamaican Voodoo Posse , who escaped without a trace - again making total fools of ...	1, 4, 6	['1', ' 4', ' 6']	1
I like the bubble . - Yeah ?	7	['7']	7
Why are you asking me all these questions ?	7	['7']	7
That's not competitive . That's ambition and talent .	5, 7	['5', ' 7']	5
Now I know how a poor little guinea pig must feel .	6	['6']	6
I've got a job to do , but I'm not hard to get along with .	8	['8']	8
Are you OK ?	4	['4']	4
Stop , [PERSON] , stop !	4	['4']	4
In fact , I admire the style of you .	5	['5']	5
We actually did recoveries of crashed saucers .	5	['5']	5
I don't got ta pay you for that .	1	['1']	1
My argument with [PERSON] had nothing to do with any sudden realization .	1	['1']	1
Silence !	3	['3']	3
Oh yeah . I had been knocked out in the pub after a shotgun to the head .	1, 7	['1', ' 7']	1
The opera starts an hour later tonight on account of the parade .	2	['2']	2
Some loser gets a crush on you , you could throw him in the river , tie him to a piano and he'd come back faster than a dog with a bone .	1, 3	['1', ' 3']	1
The whole place is gonna blow ?	2	['2']	2
Can't I have everything ?	7	['7']	7
We got a thousand man - hours on this . Nobody's walking away .	1, 2	['1', ' 2']	1
Would you like us to take a break ?	3	['3']	3
Won't you change your mind and stay for dinner , Mr. [PERSON] ?	2	['2']	2
I want to take a look .	2	['2']	2

Wasn't [PERSON] the sweetest man you ever met ?	5	['5']	5
I am so proud of you .	8, 5	['8', ' 5']	8
Oh no , I think that's a big mistake . I think you should do it .	8, 2	['8', ' 2']	8
You couldn't lend us something more like you are wearing , could you ?	3	['3']	3
Please keep in [PERSON] ?	2	['2']	2

Everyone has baggage they bring to a relationship .	6	['6']	6
He's such a nut about that car and driving fast ...	4	['4']	4
I don't understand it and I don't like it .	1	['1']	1
Can't you go in there and say something ?	1	['1']	1
We talked and joked and played chamber music .	5	['5']	5
Your sins are forgiven , my child .	8, 5	['8', ' 5']	8
Now , you look good .	5	['5']	5
[LOCATION]'s been fatal to every commander who risked his fortune there .	4	['4']	4
You picked up that awful thing to show us your contempt .	3	['3']	3
And just what exactly are your intentions , young man ?	6, 7	['6', ' 7']	6
I thought you said that they transferred him .	1, 7	['1', ' 7']	1
You're kidding me .	1, 3, 7	['1', ' 3', ' 7']	1
Don't I remember you from somewhere ?	7	['7']	7
It's wonderful and sweet champagne !	5	['5']	5
How can you be so cruel and unfeeling ?	6	['6']	6
[PERSON] was so excited about your coming .	5	['5']	5
I wish I were a woman of 36 , dressed in black satin with a string of pearls .	6	['6']	6
We got ta do something !	1, 4, 7	['1', ' 4', ' 7']	1
All right , let's go back to [LOCATION] and make this movie .	2	['2']	2
You know , I think I'll go back East and work for a while .	2	['2']	2
Your wine , your Majesty .	8	['8']	8
I lost my head for a moment , but I couldn't help it .	6	['6']	6
Where's brother ? Lookin' for that girl yet , I reckon .	8	['8']	8
What have I done ?	4, 7	['4', ' 7']	4
I don't care if it's important or not .	1	['1']	1
That's why you're getting older and she's getting younger !	1	['1']	1
You've got ten minutes to clear out .	1	['1']	1
You can do it , buddy .	2, 5	['2', ' 5']	2
You will hate me now .	6	['6']	6
It's a damn nightmare .	4	['4']	4
Don't ever do that to me again !	1, 4	['1', ' 4']	1
I haven't seen you for a week .	7	['7']	7
Haven't seen you in a long time .	7	['7']	7
The governor sounds unhinged .	6	['6']	6
Why don't you stay where you belong , in yo - yo land ?	3	['3']	3
That doesn't make him yours .	1, 3	['1', ' 3']	1
How beautiful they are	5	['5']	5
I had met [PERSON] to ask his advice .	8	['8']	8
What a dump .	3	['3']	3
Take him !	1, 3	['1', ' 3']	1
Just put on your coat .	1	['1']	1
My club ? Really ?	5, 7	['5', ' 7']	5
I am the avenger .	5	['5']	5
We were deserving the money , anyway .	1	['1']	1
So , don't try any funny business .	1	['1']	1
I am thinking of you .	5	['5']	5
Hey , clown !	1, 3	['1', ' 3']	1
Not to come to [LOCATION] , at least not for a while .	4, 6	['4', ' 6']	4
When I'm wearing a new bonnet ... all the figures I ever knew go right out of my head .	6	['6']	6
Let me at him , five minutes .	1	['1']	1
No , don't do it .	3, 4	['3', ' 4']	3
A couple months in solitary will cool you off , bugger .	3	['3']	3
She's a wonderful girl .	8	['8']	8
When I get home , I shall write a book about this place .	2	['2']	2
Never I will understand the women .	6	['6']	6
Who's askin' to see me ?	7	['7']	7
I'm warning you ...	1	['1']	1
Don't be a fool , woman .	3	['3']	3
I just got this crew broke in , so don't go screwing 'em up with your old - fashioned ways .	3	['3']	3
I thought I knew all of Grandpa's friends but I don't seem to recognize you .	7	['7']	7
You and I have had a wonderful time .	5	['5']	5
You were very good in Public Domain .	5	['5']	5
Well , it should be a pretty smooth flight . The weather's clear to [LOCATION] .	8, 5	['8', ' 5']	8
Gentlemen , how would you all like a mint julep ?	2	['2']	2
I'll drive you home .	8	['8']	8
I am not prepared for wells to run dry !	4	['4']	4
I know that you are tough .	8, 4	['8', ' 4']	8
Come on ! Come on ! - No !	1	['1']	1
Come on , it'll be great .	2	['2']	2
Die ... damn it !	1	['1']	1
But what I tell [PERSON] to do , she will do .	8, 1	['8', ' 1']	8
Look at that shit .	3	['3']	3
Drive carefully !	4	['4']	4
God , that's beautiful .	5	['5']	5
I'm terribly sorry .	6	['6']	6
But if it isn't me , then we have to make a deal , you and I , to accept that fact and find a way to stop it , OK ?	8	['8']	8
You really want it that bad ?	7	['7']	7
Some gang !	8, 1, 5	['8', ' 1', ' 5']	8
Why don't you let me help you ?	6, 7	['6', ' 7']	6
And wait till you see the pictures .	2	['2']	2
I'm going to [LOCATION] , back where I belong .	2	['2']	2
He's in on it , sir .	8, 2	['8', ' 2']	8
There are things that you could do .	2	['2']	2
I'm all packed .	5	['5']	5
The fellas are celebrating .	5	['5']	5
Isn't this the same desk ... ?	7	['7']	7
Don't you say a word unless I ask you to .	1	['1']	1
Hey , I bet you'd look good in one too .	8, 2, 5	['8', ' 2', ' 5']	8
Well , do you plan everything ?	1, 2	['1', ' 2']	1
Shut your mouth , Brother [PERSON] .	1	['1']	1
Why do we kill people who kill people to show that killing is wrong ?	3	['3']	3
We need a doctor , quick !	4	['4']	4
Christ !	7	['7']	7
These heels are grotesque .	3	['3']	3
Satan : I'll be back !	2, 5	['2', ' 5']	2
This cutter's broken .	6	['6']	6
The penis is evil .	3	['3']	3
How about a homecoming dance for your old man ?	2, 5	['2', ' 5']	2
Why not ?	2	['2']	2
I know you think I'm crazy .	6	['6']	6
I heard you're having some trouble finding help .	8	['8']	8
I was just gonna come see you .	2	['2']	2
You got him hooked ?	2, 7	['2', ' 7']	2
All right . Welcome aboard .	8	['8']	8
You've gone out of your mind .	1	['1']	1
I'm glad to see you're all right .	5	['5']	5
Don't you worry about [PERSON] . He can handle himself .	8	['8']	8
One should be able to take care of one's possessions .	3	['3']	3
[PERSON]'s not home but I am , and the front door's unlocked .	2	['2']	2
You can Do better .	1, 5	['1', ' 5']	1
Who is it ?	2	['2']	2
You know , you really are a princess .	8, 5	['8', ' 5']	8
I'm just starting to feel like ... Pretty alone .	6	['6']	6
You could make a handsome profit on your stock .	2	['2']	2
It's not going to go that far .	3	['3']	3
You've got to keep him off us .	4	['4']	4
Get out of the god damn hallway , [PERSON] .	1	['1']	1
I'm afraid it's all my fault .	6	['6']	6
I'm not at my best over the phone .	6	['6']	6
Don't do it haphazardly This spell is hard to reverse	4	['4']	4
It's coming form up there .	2	['2']	2
I always seem to come up smalltime . Except all of a sudden now , this guy [PERSON] falls right in my lap out of sheer luck .	5, 7	['5', ' 7']	5
An odd coincidence , both of you turning up here .	7	['7']	7
And now we need a law enforcement unit able to meet the enemy on his own ground and carrying enough firepower to get the job done .	4	['4']	4
We're going now , and I was afraid I wouldn't see you again .	6	['6']	6
I'll stop the car and push you out , and you'll walk the last mile home .	1	['1']	1
But you're affecting the lives of a lot of other people .	1	['1']	1
Just married .	5	['5']	5
Lord , camphor is the only known cure .	8, 4, 6	['8', ' 4', ' 6']	8
Bring my gun when you come back !	1	['1']	1
My thanks to you .	8	['8']	8
Everything's going so fast , man !	4	['4']	4
But it's our necks you're risking now , and I say no .	4	['4']	4
Have fun !	5	['5']	5
Your husband is harboring a killer .	3	['3']	3
That might be enough to win this race .	5	['5']	5
I hate them .	1	['1']	1
We're going sailing .	2	['2']	2
No , you can't leave , you're like the coolest thing about this place .	6	['6']	6
Are the payrolls ready for tomorrow ?	2	['2']	2
Then you thought up this idea .	5	['5']	5
I know I'm being disrespectful to this honourable body ...	6	['6']	6
I was a friend of the Human Beings until they stole my wife .	3	['3']	3
Get that piece of pigshit out here .	3	['3']	3
[PERSON] , if there's one thing I know about , it's Mr. [PERSON] Q. Public .	5	['5']	5
You are spoiled .	3	['3']	3
Because I want to talk to you , face to face .	8	['8']	8
Sorry you had to come back to something like this .	6	['6']	6
But when I'm lining up a deal , I don't want any dancehall woman listening in !	3	['3']	3
They may do a better job of it than we have .	8	['8']	8
His place ? You've walked into his places all unsuspecting many , many times .	2	['2']	2
Willie , you look worried .	4, 6	['4', ' 6']	4
I thought he was sick .	7	['7']	7
Did you ever get my flowers ?	1, 6	['1', ' 6']	1
You break in here , and you tell me you think [PERSON]'s a murderer .	3	['3']	3
They'll kill you and all of us .	4	['4']	4
Tries to make it look like rape .	3	['3']	3
That woman as the equal of man is entitled to equality before the law .	1	['1']	1
The smell .	3	['3']	3
You can't guarantee our luggage !	1	['1']	1
Let me get you a transfer , sir .	8	['8']	8
You're goddamn right you got the wrong room .	1	['1']	1
The law demands that I carry a certain legal reserve , and I do .	8	['8']	8
I mean , he had a great sense of humor . He wasn't another junkie with a homemade mm .	5, 6	['5', ' 6']	5
I wan na see him ...	2	['2']	2
Don't you find that restful ?	7	['7']	7
I have defeated you ?	1, 2, 7	['1', ' 2', ' 7']	1
You help me and I'll make you rich .	8	['8']	8
There ! I got it .	2, 5, 7	['2', ' 5', ' 7']	2
If you need to take a break , you can .	8, 5	['8', ' 5']	8
Then why the hell are we here ?	1, 3	['1', ' 3']	1
How come you adopted me ?	2	['2']	2
Let me be the judge of that .	1	['1']	1
What that !	7	['7']	7
Do not talk about that son of a bitch .	1	['1']	1
Why do guys always know how to hit a woman right across the cheek , wham , and it feels like your eye is going to explode ?	3, 6	['3', ' 6']	3
I was so alone , and suddenly you were there .	6	['6']	6
See , she didn't even have probable cause .	1	['1']	1
[PERSON] ! Murderer !	4, 7	['4', ' 7']	4
I'm glad you joined us when you did .	5	['5']	5
I always think that he was once somebody's baby boy .	6	['6']	6
Things started to pick up for the home team when [PERSON]'s brother , a ganef if ever I saw one , took the stand .	2	['2']	2
That'll do it .	8, 2, 5	['8', ' 2', ' 5']	8
Or a wolf ?	6	['6']	6
It's all right , don't shoot !	4	['4']	4
I know you're all right ... and a good woman at heart , even though you might have took a wrong turn in life .	8	['8']	8
I don't care if you fire me this exact fucking moment .	1	['1']	1
You know the streets . You know the dealers .	8	['8']	8
For a celebrated bounder , that is an awful admission .	3	['3']	3
You oughtta try it , it might clear your head .	5	['5']	5
I wake up in the middle of the night and laugh at them .	5	['5']	5
But you said it was safe .	4	['4']	4
Your blood will thicken .	1	['1']	1
You'll punish me .	3	['3']	3
You look good !	5	['5']	5
We are taking The Nautilus down for the last time .	2, 4	['2', ' 4']	2
Put your swords down !	1	['1']	1
Okay , we're all going into the vault now .	2	['2']	2
Sorry , I'm just trying to make polite conversation .	1	['1']	1
Little [PERSON]'s been so lonely ...	6	['6']	6
One of the many troubles with you , Harry , is , you never know where your movie scripts leave off and life begins .	3	['3']	3
Don't worry about it .	8	['8']	8
We're realists , knowing that we're on the outside looking in . - We calmly accept our uncertain position . - Yeah .	8, 5	['8', ' 5']	8
Everybody calls you plain [PERSON] , why can't I ?	1	['1']	1
And I lied to the police about him .	5	['5']	5
Remember to chew them well , okay ?	8	['8']	8
Are you a scarecrow's son ?	3	['3']	3
But you look like you're more upset than that .	6	['6']	6
Miss , has the Cowboy ever told you of his incredible tolerance for pain ?	2	['2']	2
Look , in what I do , there are sometimes pressures .	4	['4']	4
Don't you know it's bad to light forest fires ?	1, 3, 7	['1', ' 3', ' 7']	1
We've been very happy here .	5	['5']	5
Very , very soon .	2	['2']	2
It's no use anyway .	3, 6	['3', ' 6']	3
You should just get over what happened to you in your adolescence . It is time to move on .	8, 2	['8', ' 2']	8
If you want to catch that boat you better stop talking .	1	['1']	1
Which we don't care about losing , by the way .	8, 2	['8', ' 2']	8
Never , not even for a minute , I believed that you had been .	8, 4, 7	['8', ' 4', ' 7']	8
I thought it my duty to warn you .	8	['8']	8
Would you really wear a thing like that ?	3, 6, 7	['3', ' 6', ' 7']	3
One !	7	['7']	7
Oh , [PERSON] , for people like you and me the world can be a wonderful place .	5	['5']	5
I have the satisfaction that all her pictures have been stinkers since I stopped writing them .	1, 3	['1', ' 3']	1
Wait till I ask Dad if this is any way to run an airline .	1	['1']	1
It can't be that difficult .	1	['1']	1
The desert ?	2	['2']	2
That's what comes of teaching science by TV .	3, 6, 7	['3', ' 6', ' 7']	3
It's the blood , bone and sinew of this democracy that great men handed down to the human race !	1	['1']	1
Uh , [PERSON] ? Here .	8, 2	['8', ' 2']	8
It's all taken care of , Papa .	8	['8']	8
Look after you .	4	['4']	4
I told you I'd handle him .	1	['1']	1
He spares us the mercifully quick extinction of the hangman's rope ... and gives the slow death of slavery .	6	['6']	6
That man really does his job .	8	['8']	8
The more you find out about us [PERSON] , the more impressive we become .	5	['5']	5
If I see you in the stands , it make me feel better .	5	['5']	5
Did I ...	4	['4']	4
He's selling drugs around upstairs , and he's got the rest of them locked up down here without any rights .	1	['1']	1
I knew you'd come . I was ... I was waiting !	1, 2, 5	['1', ' 2', ' 5']	1
How are you ? - I'm OK .	8	['8']	8
A vast area would be uninhabitable , with many cancer cases later .	4	['4']	4
My return to consciousness was a plunge into a new level of pain .	6	['6']	6
Ripping out phones , urinating on desks .	3, 7	['3', ' 7']	3
Well , I'm pleased to have seen you again , Mr. [PERSON] .	5	['5']	5
I've been trained for it .	8	['8']	8
Won't you tell us all about it ?	2	['2']	2
I'm afraid we must go , dear .	6	['6']	6
Even if they got lost somewhere .	4	['4']	4
The best died there .	6	['6']	6
I got up and started to speak and the long powerful arm of [PERSON] reached into this sacred chamber and grabbed me by the neck .	4	['4']	4
It can not sit down in wet cushions .	3	['3']	3
Guns for them ?	4	['4']	4
I don't believe what we have done .	7	['7']	7
They all come in with a whimper , and leave with a grin .	2	['2']	2
Hey , you know there was a guy in the game that accused me of juicing the deck ?	1, 7	['1', ' 7']	1
Doctor , you're with me .	8	['8']	8
I didn't hear no bell !	1	['1']	1
I must be honest with you .	8	['8']	8
I've called you dozens of times .	1	['1']	1
We can try .	2	['2']	2
It's for a good cause .	5	['5']	5
Why don't you put this on ?	2	['2']	2
Now he's living in , his wife just bought half of [LOCATION] [LOCATION] and I'm sitting here pulling my putz .	1, 3	['1', ' 3']	1
The whole point is just to enjoy yourself .	5	['5']	5
What is schizophrenia but a horrifying state where what's in here doesn't match what's out there ?	4	['4']	4
Find someone else to sing about .	1	['1']	1
Years ago , when we still had executions in the state he used to volunteer as a witness .	3	['3']	3
Trying to make her think her husband is still alive .	6	['6']	6
I'll tell your dad I did , okay .	8	['8']	8
He's a gutless wonder .	3	['3']	3
Mainly because I had to wrestle that son of a bitch all the way from [LOCATION] .	1	['1']	1
You know , be very close .	2	['2']	2
You have talent , I made the best use of it .	8, 2, 5	['8', ' 2', ' 5']	8
He wants you downtown , like , yesterday .	1	['1']	1
He has to testify again in [LOCATION] in days , but he not gonna make it now because by tomorrow this story's in the newspaper .	4	['4']	4
Ah , thank you .	5	['5']	5
Slip the jab , [PERSON] !	8, 3	['8', ' 3']	8
That's nice .	5	['5']	5
Help me .	8, 4	['8', ' 4']	8
What does that say ?	2	['2']	2
What's your duty , sir ?	2	['2']	2
Admiral know what that is ?	8, 4, 7	['8', ' 4', ' 7']	8
But my problem is , there's a terrible crime committed today and I haven't told the police .	2, 4	['2', ' 4']	2
Look , lon , what you did to me with this woman .	3	['3']	3
If it's so nutritious , how come I don't see you eating it ?	3	['3']	3
I want my million .	2	['2']	2
Sorry for the slight inconvenience , Your Honor .	8, 3, 4, 6	['8', ' 3', ' 4', ' 6']	8
And guess what ? We're coming to see you tomorrow .	8, 5	['8', ' 5']	8
If Mr. [PERSON] says he'll get you another body , he'll get you another body ... every bit as good as your own , if not better .	8	['8']	8
[PERSON] put me onto this .	4	['4']	4
How about my wrist ?	4	['4']	4
You idiot .	1, 3	['1', ' 3']	1
Seems like I hear everything that goes on in this dump .	3	['3']	3
The whole buck ?	2, 7	['2', ' 7']	2
I want to die .	6	['6']	6
Think God punishes the King to have a French whore .	1, 3	['1', ' 3']	1
You want us to believe that ?	7	['7']	7
Imagine , an important part of my life wasted between whistles .	6	['6']	6
It is my prison .	3	['3']	3
Be gone , Satan !	1	['1']	1
gonna be held as sheriff , if they elect me .	2	['2']	2
Fuck off , [PERSON] .	1	['1']	1
Did you hear that , honey ?	7	['7']	7
Some of them are carved in stone , some of them men like [PERSON] put up there , so suckers like me could read them .	6	['6']	6
Sweet !	5	['5']	5
You're doing good .	8, 5	['8', ' 5']	8
No , no .	1	['1']	1
Can't anyone love me without it being life or death to them ?	6	['6']	6
You watch me .	8, 2	['8', ' 2']	8
I'm afraid I can not accept your evaluation of Cdr . Owynn .	6	['6']	6
We'll have dinner at the St Regis , go to a nice snappy show , then to a nightclub , sit and listen to the soft music , and who knows ?	2	['2']	2
So , what happened after he climbed up the tower and rescued her ?	2	['2']	2
There will be no more movies for days .	1	['1']	1
The dishes are on the table , the refrigerator door was open ...	3	['3']	3
I know her far better than you do .	1	['1']	1
Maybe she even killed my partner , [PERSON] .	1, 3	['1', ' 3']	1
To kill the brutals who multiply and are legion .	3	['3']	3
You treat her bad .	3	['3']	3
The questions will float to the surface .	2	['2']	2
I haven't the data yet .	6	['6']	6
The gun , honey dripper .	3	['3']	3
She lied !	1, 3	['1', ' 3']	1
How long will they be ?	2	['2']	2
He's gone to .	5	['5']	5
Oh , I wanted you to see this advertising layout .	2	['2']	2
I don't deny that you might have a case .	8	['8']	8
let's drink to , uh , making new friends .	8	['8']	8
As things are , there's no need for you to go through the Customs .	8	['8']	8
Okay .	8, 2, 5	['8', ' 2', ' 5']	8
Damn glad to meet you .	5	['5']	5
No . Not the rangers . What'll I do ?	4, 7	['4', ' 7']	4
Go home !	1	['1']	1
It's the son of a bitch who painted this car , that's who . Yeah , that's what a real criminal is .	3	['3']	3
Hey , lighten up !	8, 2, 5	['8', ' 2', ' 5']	8
Is it bleeding ?	4	['4']	4
The coach was robbed and [PERSON] killed .	4	['4']	4
It's impolite to stare .	3	['3']	3
I don't think we can get it done by Monday .	6	['6']	6
In my mind's eyes I see three circles joined in priceless , graceful harmony .	5	['5']	5
You're lying .	3	['3']	3
Because you talked me into this , that's why , you idiot !	3	['3']	3
He was safe .	5	['5']	5
I can see very well , thank you .	1, 2	['1', ' 2']	1
Will you tell me what awful thing I did to you when you were a child ?	3, 6	['3', ' 6']	3
It's no bluff .	8	['8']	8
Can you explain your testimony that there is more stringent posting rules for selling a motorcycle than selling a - year - old ?	1	['1']	1
feet and rising , sir .	4	['4']	4
That was pretty fancy wrestling , kid .	5	['5']	5
Please don't go .	4, 6	['4', ' 6']	4
What ? They took her body .	4	['4']	4
Sure we're friends .	1	['1']	1
You get in trouble over there , and I'd have a hell of a time gettin' you out .	1	['1']	1
You go to the embassy !	1	['1']	1
Oh , I needed that .	2, 5	['2', ' 5']	2
Poor country ! You sold the [LOCATION] in a senseless war .	6	['6']	6
I'll go with you .	2	['2']	2
That's no way to remember him .	6	['6']	6
I couldn't possibly sit still .	2	['2']	2
Terrific .	5	['5']	5
You wouldn't be offended if I call the police ?	7	['7']	7
I'm used to making my deals on a solid basis .	8	['8']	8
Well , for god's sake , it's my account .	1	['1']	1
What is he looking at ?	2	['2']	2
We came to love him .	5	['5']	5
It's very important to relax , old boy .	5	['5']	5
That shouldn't be too hard to find out , [PERSON]'s wide open .	2	['2']	2
They'd give me ten to twenty years !	4	['4']	4
I'm merely reflecting on your extraordinary good fortune .	1	['1']	1
He never make a fool of myself , ever .	8, 5	['8', ' 5']	8
A fitting demise to the Prince of Powder .	8, 5	['8', ' 5']	8
The death of [PERSON] is a tragedy .	6	['6']	6
Are you quite certain this place was full of people only a few minutes ago ?	7	['7']	7
Embarrassing , Your Majesty ?	4	['4']	4
It's all that's left of him now . Just a box of bits and pieces .	3	['3']	3
I said hold your goddamn fire !	1	['1']	1
A lost decade , but it was worth it to make your father pay for my loss .	1	['1']	1
You got something against fat people , too ?	3	['3']	3
I'm still in my office , I'll wait for you .	2, 5	['2', ' 5']	2
I kept my mouth shut because I didn't want them to get in trouble .	6	['6']	6
No . Not this time .	1	['1']	1
That's [PERSON]'s , he values that . He won it ! Good !	5, 7	['5', ' 7']	5
Can't you walk faster ?	1	['1']	1
I didn't expect you to .	2, 3, 7	['2', ' 3', ' 7']	2
All right , fine . Let's do it .	8	['8']	8
Sent what ?	4	['4']	4
It adds a few miles to our trip , but somehow I've become a little sentimental .	6	['6']	6
That's two accidents in a week .	4	['4']	4
Usually , I just reach out my hand , and obstacles disappear .	5, 7	['5', ' 7']	5
You hit the books tonight and I'll listen to you tomorrow .	8	['8']	8
Help me , please ! - Get him off me !	4	['4']	4
So , now it's time to pay the fiddler !	1, 4	['1', ' 4']	1
Next thing you know , boom .	7	['7']	7
Hundreds !	7	['7']	7
The things we have to do in these heathen countries . There must be an easier way to set a trap !	1, 3	['1', ' 3']	1
The beast is at the gates !	4	['4']	4
I apologise for his appointment .	6	['6']	6
I'll take control away from him .	1	['1']	1
I don't think she's intelligent either .	3	['3']	3
Oh , come on . It just would have been some cushy white - collar resort .	6	['6']	6
It's funny , she didn't mention a husband .	7	['7']	7
It's fine , we're leaving ,	1	['1']	1
I see the monster .	4	['4']	4
He said you were a saintly old man who didn't hold with all the vices .	7	['7']	7
I mean , this is the Supreme Court .	1	['1']	1
Well , don't be so mysterious .	1	['1']	1
That's perfectly all right .	5	['5']	5
A sense of humor .	8	['8']	8
Those dirty bastards !	3	['3']	3
You just do what I tell you from now on , [PERSON] .	1, 2	['1', ' 2']	1
Rocky's hurt .	6	['6']	6
I know I speak for my entire radio audience when I express my great admiration for both of you .	5	['5']	5
You'll soon be in [LOCATION] now .	2	['2']	2
My back !	6	['6']	6
Hey , that's it .	5, 7	['5', ' 7']	5
Please , give me one more minute !	4, 6	['4', ' 6']	4
Man , you beat the best .	8	['8']	8
The town is perfectly all right .	5	['5']	5
Sister [PERSON] , you play great game of balls . How come ?	2, 5, 7	['2', ' 5', ' 7']	2
Honey , I haven't had a chance to really talk to her ...	6	['6']	6
He said no pilots .	6, 7	['6', ' 7']	6
Schmuck , listen to me .	3	['3']	3
I've got a headache , [PERSON] .	6	['6']	6
I know what you're thinking .	2	['2']	2
LeAnn's in [LOCATION] , trying to close the deal for the debate .	8	['8']	8
I love you .	8, 5	['8', ' 5']	8
And this spic , [PERSON] , what a fucking nut case .	1, 3, 7	['1', ' 3', ' 7']	1
You preached about faith and other rubbish .	3	['3']	3
Okay ? You're gonna check in with me on a nightly basis .	5, 7	['5', ' 7']	5
I most certainly do love her .	5	['5']	5
C'mon , rest awhile girl .	4, 6	['4', ' 6']	4
This is great !	5	['5']	5
Maybe you'll even put in a good word for me ?	8	['8']	8
It wouldn't take that long if we had the right kind of government .	3	['3']	3
Gentlemen , there's a God in heaven .	8	['8']	8
[PERSON] , I'm disappointed in you . Hiding under a nest while [PERSON] needs help .	1, 6	['1', ' 6']	1
Why is there a statue of a husky ?	7	['7']	7
Sure , but that's good , too .	5	['5']	5
No , I don't want no drink .	1	['1']	1
Not [PERSON] ?	7	['7']	7
No , I have not been away all that time .	6	['6']	6

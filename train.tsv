Looks like a goddamn freak show out there .	3
I am through being a go - between for you and your dream girl .	1
You . I trust you , [PERSON] .	8
That's why your wife dumped you .	3
You know , because you think of generals , and you think of Conservatives and Republicans as being very pro-military and business .	6, 7
That's wonderful , darling .	5
Another $ ? - That was from way before .	4
I can't remember . - You can't remember ?	7
All dead , you mean !	1

This test may tell us why .	2
I'm gonna see it if I have to go blind trying .	1
Assuming that the captain's conduct often showed bad judgement . - - Would that be inconsistent with your diagnosis of him ?	2
Like myself , it struggled blindly for the means to live .	6
Do you really want to know ?	7
Aye , sir .	8
Were you close with the deceased ?	6
There has seldom been a man so unwise , so headstrong but he could see the necessity of keeping friends and not making enemies at court .	3

Now ...	3
Say , wait a minute .	7
The war will be over in a few weeks , and I'll be coming back to you .	2
A rebel .	3
Standard opening . And now , you are being deliberately stupid .	1, 3
I'm going to be next week .	2
What do I care about your philosophy of the soldier ?	1
Compliments of Capt. [PERSON] .	5
He was my only boy , and I love him so much .	8, 5, 6
Who's got time to wonder what happened to some ridiculous talking mice when you're driving by at 75 , miles an hour ?	3
Could I get a level from you , please ?	8, 2
Mind out , cuz .	1

She seems to be feeling a lot better .	5
ESP exists , [PERSON] . They proved it .	5, 7

A fitting demise to the Prince of Powder .	8, 5
Uh-oh .	4
By making a lot of idiotic loans ?	3
Did you come to see me for the same reason as the man with sweat on his face ?	3
The less the girl hears , the better .	4
I am not the man you thought I was .	3, 6
♪ Poo - poo , pee - too ♪	5
And then there is always a possibility that ... - you won't survive that long .	4
You think you'd like to try that before you eat ?	2
Nothing ever happens .	6
The shameless way in which the deficiency bill has been delayed is nothing short of criminal .	3
Do you remember what sins ?	2
Ghosts ?	4
Well , maybe things will be better over there .	2
I'm going to [LOCATION] , back where I belong .	2
That sounds swell , [PERSON] .	5

That's the stuff he fills the children's heads with !	3
I told you I didn't do anything illegal and I didn't .	8
Nothing's impossible .	5
Those were the last words she heard me say .	6
It isn't like it used to be .	6
Look , [PERSON] , I - I've known all along That you were stealing food and treasure .	6
I got it !	5
You won't take my check . I'll say .	1

Daisy , you look lovely .	5
Will you tell me what awful thing I did to you when you were a child ?	3, 6
What are you doing with my uncle's briefcase ?	7

Right there ... in those big blue eyes .	8, 2
There they are !	5
Of course , a box !	7

God bless you .	8, 5
This is so great .	5
I completely agree .	5
I thought we should get acquainted , since we're neighbours .	8
What I don't understand is whether someone was trying to kill [PERSON] ... or whether someone was trying to kill [PERSON] because she was with you .	4
It is probable that the last dose is fatal .	6
As I told you , it's time we did something about it .	1
They can't keep the department out of it .	1
I don't like your type in my streets .	3

Lieutenant , what the hell is that thing ?	1, 7

This is your shit bucket , folks .	3
Oh , this is terrible .	4
Would you mind giving me a hand ?	2
But this is a family emergency , we do need you at home ,	4
The worst thing that could happen is I'd have a nice meal in a good restaurant .	2, 5
And Barley ?	2
That's [PERSON] park , Mr. computer from downstairs . Some of the hardware is so outdated .	3
Now we are running out of ammunition .	4

It does matter .	6
How may times do I have to tell you ?	1

One matters of saying to us , Mr. [PERSON] , where it was in the Monday afternoon , day of June ?	1, 2
I only hope it isn't too high for you here .	4
[PERSON] thinks he's such a nice dog .	5
[PERSON] knows what she's doing .	8
Go to bed at night happy and then murdered .	4
I'll kill him !	1
Tell him it's none of his business .	1
I'd give you a kiss right now , but I'm afraid I'll ruin my makeup .	5
Are you all alone in there ?	6
I can't handle basic training again , man .	6
Some official's son got in trouble and they're looking for a substitute	6
That might be enough to win this race .	5
You think it's a good idea to hand me an ax right now ?	1
That's not judge [PERSON] .	7
It wasn't worth it .	1
A hundred years from now , nobody will know the difference .	2
That's the first thing Cross taught me .	8
I can't believe it was you on the phone .	7
Then , you still believed you could make a difference .	6
What flight and what name ? The name is ...	2
Don't settle for less because you're a whole lot more than that . 	8, 1
We're on vacation .	5
Hey , wait your turn .	1

Why would anyone recognize me ?	1, 3, 6
You'd want your mommy too , if you had to say all this . - Cut !	1
I'm worried about the future , and what people will think .	4
Any favours that I do for you don't need any payment .	8
There's more where that came from .	2
I just want you to leave me alone .	1, 3, 6
I appreciate that , Agent [PERSON] .	8, 5
You can't take a bill nobody's heard of and discuss it among 96 , men .	1
I'm peeing my pants .	3, 4, 6
I know we can work through the petty stuff .	8, 2
I've had 10 , years to get ready for this .	2
Let's go get them , baby .	2
We assume that no commander of a [LOCATION] naval ship can possibly be a coward .	8
Give him quinine and stop pretending you're [PERSON] .	1
[PERSON] , she tore the fuckin' place apart .	3
Actually , we don't know a soul here .	7
It's portable , long - range , very expensive .	8, 2, 7
He's a real pro .	8
Car exploded outside .	4
[PERSON] , I don't mind you being stupid , but this is crazy .	3
Do you speak english ? - ( speaks spanish )	7

Come on ! What's it mean , anyway ?	3
Because I always get lucky .	5
When does it happen ? When ?	4
Yeah . What did you ask up , buddy ?	2
So , congratulations , Admiral [PERSON] .	8, 5
Well , how did it go ?	2
Thank you , Lord !	5
How do I undo the spell ?	4
I haven't been up this early in years .	7
Amateur .	1, 3
Well , for starters , you can give me an update .	1
The man with the sweat was more pleasant than you .	3
I'm broke .	6
You can hardly expect the jury to believe that a woman in love doesn't attempt to meet her lover .	1
Is it that you think it'll be better for ... for all of us if you go away ?	6
You know , you have a worse mouth than my kid .	3
Death everywhere and you and me in the middle .	8, 6
Yes , Father , I'll tell him when he comes back .	8
I have no fucking idea why they towed it .	1
If the check hasn't cleared , we can still get out of it .	2
You beast .	3
All right , talk !	1, 2
I thought he didn't drink .	7
You should try it .	2
Unsatisfactory .	1, 3
That's right , boy .	8
You're my boss , that's it .	3
That's a stolen car .	4, 7
I'll use my magic to banish them !	1
[PERSON] asked me if I wanted to see him again .	7
Think he'll give me a raise ?	2
Hey , did you find him ?	2
She was very nervous when we left [LOCATION] .	6

Thank you , ma'am .	8
And now , he wants to buy me ?	2
I was free .	5

A Hexenbiest with your powers could be a very valuable asset to someone who respects them .	8
That's him right there !	2, 7
Hey , Kid .	8
Get down there , son !	8, 2
I hope to see more of you , when you're free of the spell of Mr. [PERSON] .	2
So , now I'm supposed to roll over like a bitch dog getting my belly scratched ?	3
The man has the biggest murder case in the city ... And he has to kiss your ring ?	3
I need to get up to see some people named [PERSON] .	2
I understand perfectly .	7
I only hope that you're good enough for the [PERSON] .	2
[PERSON] says he didn't rent a car . The rental company says he did . Whatever .	6
I really am in a hurry .	4
Don't you dare .	1
I shall wish a book jacket that is only letters .	8, 2
That's why you're getting older and she's getting younger !	1
There's nothing I can do about squabbles in the imperial court	1
Thank you . Good night .	5
Especially with a fortune in our falsies .	5
I can't start acting like a father now .	4, 6
I can't stand to see him hurt .	6

Think them folks would spend a penny to send you east ?	3
But you're affecting the lives of a lot of other people .	1
One look from the head of [LOCATION] can turn all creatures into stone .	4
On it , you'll find the safest route .	8
This kid , bulldozing his way into our lives .	3
A pleasure to meet someone who understands that to the true gambler ... money is never an end in itself but simply a tool , as language is to thought .	8, 5
[PERSON] has disappeared .	1, 4, 6, 7
I thought I was someone who I wasn't .	7
Can you do me a favor and tell mom I'm okay And I'm not coming home .	8, 4
Nobody's gonna make me do that !	1
You're full of surprises .	7
It was nice of you to break your date .	5
And goddamn it , tuck up those pyjamas !	3
Could a battalion cross those peaks at night ?	2
Keep your mouth shut !	1
How long do you expect the world to believe those aren't your soldiers ?	3
Don't be afraid .	8
When did he die ?	6, 7
So I'm just asking you ... to be with me .	8
Relax ? I have never been more relaxed in my life !	1
My little finger , it's all black and blue .	4

But they began spreading wild rumours about steaming in circles . -	1, 4
Maybe you'll even put in a good word for me ?	8
Why can't I play with you ?	6
Oh , here we are . - Oh .	7
It could work if the government would spend more money .	6
[PERSON] , take care of this .	8
Tomorrow , you'll be looking for a new cobbler or a new teacher .	2
Probably I'm prejudiced , but it seems to me that [PERSON] is a pretty cute young lady .	5

Sometimes I think there's almost a chance for us .	5
It will get me in much trouble .  	4, 6
I'm not down . You look depressed .	5
Lovely woman . - Yes , I imagine what is .	5
Why do guys always know how to hit a woman right across the cheek , wham , and it feels like your eye is going to explode ?	3, 6
Well , he really got his monster , didn't he ?	1, 5
Honey , I haven't had a chance to really talk to her ...	6

She was so kind of offering hospitality to seven of my compatriots , refugees of our birth - place .	8, 5
Do you think we're getting anywhere ?	4
Whatever you need , it's yours .	8, 5

From now on we are .	5
He must be in shock . This rush , this adrenaline , the fear .	4
She's turnin' around !	5, 7
Aren't you going to ask me to sit down ?	7
But when the sick one is yourself , you can not run away .	6
She'll listen to you , you're not her mother .	8, 5
I knew that if anyone could help me , you could .	8
If he likes running his fingers through my hair , well , why not ?	5
Occupational hazard ?	4
Who sent you ? - Fuck you .	1
Everybody's a screwball in some way .	2, 3, 5, 6, 8
I made it ashore , but I got separated from the other survivors .	4
Oh , [PERSON] would be mighty proud of you if you won yourself $ , .	2, 5

He'll come here first .	2
Please stop it .	1
And in the enchantment of the moment , we'd let poetry work its magic .	5
Forgive me ...	6
If you come back , I promise I'll never do anything naughty again .	8, 2
I want to talk to my brothers .	2
Give me your blessing for a happy voyage .	8
Then it's all settled .	8
God , it was bright .	1
You need a good pop on the butt like I used to give your mother !	1
When we first went there , [PERSON] , he could barely speak .	6
I wan na feel good about something sometime .	6
Where are you going ? - I have a date .	5

It was terrible . He screamed with fear .	6
It's not an easy thing to do .	4, 6
You know , [PERSON] is not gonna last five minutes out there .	4
You speak to me of code ?	3
We don't know what we're dealing with .	4
Excuse me , sir . Exactly how obscene an amount of money were you talking about ?	7
You don't really think I don't want you to do well ? No , [PERSON] .	6
The tour was very interesting .	5
You gave me some very valuable information .	8
You talk like a madman .	3
Well , the tall guy is not really a friend .	3
And then I shot him .	1
He wasn't a boy , he was seventeen .	1
He's a wonderful man .	5
Get out of there !	4
Get in touch with them . Meet us at the border .	2
But ... good lord , yes !	5

She'll talk about the Triad robbery , she'll name Case , then us .	2
This heat is really something .	7
It's a background check .	1
That old bastard's killed more guys than the electric chair .	3
You think I don't know why you got me down here on this cockamamie case ?	1, 3
Who are you ?	1, 3
It doesn't have to be like this .	6
He walks into the house without even knocking .	3

Every dog I ever knew seemed to have a very nice life indeed .	5
Naturally .	1, 3, 5
It'll only get you in trouble .	4
But we have a hotplate and a well - stocked refrigerator .	5

I'd really like to help you .	8
Well , I will be very glad to hear it .	2
An immense reservoir of nature , Where I roam at will .	5
I'd like you to ride with us .	2
The majority of children that we see trafficked online have been trafficked on Backpage .	3
You just don't bury a famous movie star like she was an unidentified body .	3, 6
You know what ?	2, 7
It's all here .	7
I've escaped !	5
Let him speak !	1
That is very interesting , mon ami .	2

I swear I didn't know .	3, 4, 6, 7
There ! Come on , everybody . Get some more stuff !	5
That's how it looks in my report unless you've got something to change it .	1
If he is to be sacrificed before [PERSON] , why is he not painted red ?	7
Soon they'll make admirals out of captains with guts .	1
You have exact change ?	2
I couldn't possibly sit still .	2
You get off wearing women's clothing ?	7
They took her .	1, 4
This has been a mess since it began ...  	4
You heard about this guy , [PERSON] ?	2
Oh , my boobs are killing me .	3
What the fuck takes a week ?	1, 2
Try something now , the brat gets his .	3
I'm not gonna hurt you .	8
My return to consciousness was a plunge into a new level of pain .	6
What the hels going on ? 	1
But it was professional .	8
We got nothing to talk about .	1
That's the boy wonder ?	7
I will follow the Senator's example and refuse to remain in this chamber as long as that man holds the floor !	1
It all began one night when the lights went out. ,	2, 4
We owed a great deal of money and I had no job .	6
There are people eager to work with you .	8
He knew of everything for [PERSON] .	2
Why not believe me ?	1
I got enough problems with my old man .	4, 6
Did I do something wrong ?	4
I think we're stuck .	4
I am away , sick .	6
Excuse me your highnesses , but you're going to be late , And this restaurant recipe begs to order .	2, 4
She's two hundred years old .	7
The defence has an interesting point .	7
Mr. [PERSON] , are you opposing me ?	1
When's the next ferry ?	2
It's like that time in [LOCATION] when he made me walk ... stripped down to only my long - handles and my hat .	4
A quarter of a million dollars ?	7
You're a killer .	3
Blowing them up .	1, 4
Because I do not like you , Mom .	1, 7
Oh , you're the best , [PERSON] .	5
We're all gonna die !	4
You are in love with her .	8, 5
[PERSON] never seemed worried about anything like that .	7
Shoot him !	1
I know you were deeply touched by [PERSON]'s gesture ,	5
Now look , Captain , you're an educated man .	8
I told you to fasten your seat belt .	1
Only two months ' treatment , and I'm a well man .	5
Sorry about the Chiefs , [PERSON] .	6
I could cover you with kisses .	5
Who's that ?	4, 7
Do not try to skip !	8, 1, 7
I want Dad's yacht fueled and ready for two weeks at [LOCATION] by the time I get there .	2
His foolish involvement with Lady forgotten [PERSON] ...	1, 3
But it's very good !	5
We can't live with lies .	6
May I help you ? Miss Vale .	2
Tell me what ?	7
If you lay a hand on her ...	1
I can't see myself .	4
I don't like it , [PERSON] .	3
I don't want any luck .	1
Listen , maybe you and I could get together sometime after [PERSON] leaves .	8, 2
I'll take you back and dump you .	1
I discovered that actually [PERSON] was not in [LOCATION] ... when the storm of battle broke .	7
I promised .	8
Tonight , we go and make party .	2
Can't you humor him ? I need a favor .	8, 1
Didn't you tell me to call you in five minutes ?	1
Cut the conversation .	1
Every citizen will have a living unit , safe , secure , and clean .	8
Well , he'd better be if he's gonna remain anything at all .	1
Get out of here !	1, 2
Where's your sense of humor ?	7
We'll always be here with you , ma'am .	8, 5
If you lay one finger on that poor , sweet , helpless girl ... you'll despise yourself forever .	3
I'm uncomfortable with whatever this is .	3
I will give him an alibi and I shall be very convincing .	8
I want to talk to you tonight .	8
Well , all I can say at this time , that the most important thing is unity ... and the public's faith in the institution of democracy .	8
How can you drink that shit ?	3
Stand back .	1
But I'm not sure anything else makes sense right now .	4
They send me home a hero and I say wonderful things about them back in the [LOCATION] .	5
You're afraid of me .	4
Hi ! - Hi ! - What the fuck are you doing here ?	7
Well , you're so much stronger than I am .	6
But it's now the military industrial intelligence complex that are moving bureaucratically towards establishing dominion and control over the entire democratic process in the country .	4
Let him back in , [PERSON] , now .	1
Don't leave me !	4, 6
Somebody starts a rumour and they lose their heads .	4
If you need to take a break , you can .	8, 5
Mother , I'll have to skip your party tonight .	3, 6
Fighting so he can stand on his own two feet , free and decent .	2
He'd been caught stealing rations . - I see .	7
For us , business is lousy .	6
Now , if you don't , then I will suspend you .	1, 2
Yeah , yeah , yeah .	1
He never turned up at all .	1
We could have been killed .	4
They been bothering me .	1
I can steal it , Mr. [PERSON] ?	3
Aarfy , if anything happens to me , will you take care of my girl ?	4
This itself may have placed the entire country's safety in jeopardy .	4
We'll do this thing together .	8, 2, 4, 5
It astonished me .	7
Maybe if I do you , then I wouldn't care about losing millions of dollars .	2, 6
Thanks , Kid .	2, 5
Let's get hold of this [PERSON] before the others do .	1
Don't you want me with you ?	6
Burn them all away .	3
She knew something .	7
That looks really good .	2, 5
Bingo . You've got a right to open your collar , take off your shoes and relax in [LOCATION] for the rest of your life .	2
That man really does his job .	8
He's got another woman !	1
Because when you talked about murder on the tapes ... I assumed it was just hallucination .	6
How ya doin' ?	2
Yes . Yes . Plays cards like an English officer and a gentleman .	7
All she could do was drink and cry , like you .	3
So maybe if I screw you and take you to the opera , then I can be happy . Hey !	5, 7
Five Wounds , for short .	6
And the [LOCATION] had great plans for me .	2
How can I ?	6
Hey , [PERSON] . - What ? - You see the stars on the sidewalk ?	2
Look , I was a bit of an asshole .	6
I like him so much .	8, 5, 7
You'll know ...	2
I want to know everything what happened .	2
This can be established .	8
Hit the brakes !	4
Uh-oh uh-oh ... Why did you take down the [LOCATION] Lace number ?	4
Yes , Rock .	5
Thank you , [PERSON] . Thank you very much , man .	8
We're ready with that live feed .	2
Um ... Yeah .	7
How about a homecoming dance for your old man ?	2, 5
Who was it ?	1
I love you too much , you know that .	5
We've collected the rest of the grenade fragments .	8, 4
You can't arrest me here .	1
I wanted to buy you something lovely and exotic .	5
We throw ourselves at your mercy .	4
I'm with you .	8, 5
Now take these light bulbs out back and don't break 'em .	8
You're liable to get caught .	4
Look , sir , we haven't much time .	4
That's a bunch of bullshit .	3
Think they'll give me a job of responsibility ?	2
Heh . Heh .	5
But you look like you're more upset than that .	6
Or a liar .	3
There must be a reason .	8
Och , you don't want to let them worry you .	8
I've never known anyone as capable and intelligent .	8
I sent you all those letters .	7
Let me finish , sweet .	2
I never had the chance to apologize to her .	6
[LOCATION]'s been fatal to every commander who risked his fortune there .	4
For pocket money he helps some of the older residents with their groceries .	8, 2
One of the theories we have is that Backpage is , in fact , in a conspiracy with the pimps , that the posting rules are not designed to prevent or to stop human sex trafficking , but in fact , are designed to be a guide to pimps to allow them to design an ad which helps them evade law enforcement .	1, 3
This is your evening .	5
Get the hell up because I'm out here alone .	4
King's Cross , please .	2
How much longer is this [PERSON] going to hold out ?	2
You are spoiled .	3
Hey , Crystal , I want to show you this . Now , what's gonna happen here ...	1
You taught me a lesson , man .	8
Much later , [PERSON] !	3
In the dirt , it's hard to tell .	2
You could tell it was for real , because they never even gave out interviews about getting married .	8
I know him through and through .	8
You and that damn book .	1
It's not right . I'm gonna go check it out .	4
Why don't we see if we can find a nice place for her .	2, 4, 6
It's bad .	8, 4
No , you don't !	4
But even so , it is quite awful when nobody in loves , is not ?	6
I like to read .	5
The cellar is the only safe place .	4
You couldn't lend us something more like you are wearing , could you ?	3
He wants to give you all his support .	8
He's dying .	6
Prostitutes will try to tempt you with their unhealthy immorality .	3
Will you please stop telling me how to run my life for a couple of minutes ?	1
And I'll see you in court in three weeks .	1
Maybe that's where they're keeping the kids .	7
I regret your aggressiveness , [PERSON] .	3
No . Decide already !	1
Safe from what ?	7
I brought my man [PERSON] here to see how you big boys work .	8
You are one ugly mother ... Motherfucker !	3
You bet !	5
I couldn't get the cook on such short notice , so we're on our own .	6
Summertime , all you can smell is the garbage .	3
And I panicked , and I lied .	4, 6
Probably not , hon , but somebody else's folks will be ... all that sand to brush off .	1
Now you've had it !	1
Go get my children and you bring them back .	8
There's no bloody exits .	1
I was scared shitless they'd think I was still alive .	4
Sir [PERSON] , I presume ?	2, 5
All I want to do is make things as difficult as possible .	1
He don't even work .	3
Look at me , I'm free !	5
It doesn't matter . They run a little family grocery shop back home .	2, 5
So what'd you do ?	4
After that , things kind of went downhill .	6, 7
He should come out of it any moment .	2
You better straighten your tie , [PERSON] ! Or poppa'll spank you !	1, 3
Then we understand each other .	8
We need to leave now .	4, 6
Deal ?	2
The way she's lying , there won't be any steel plate to have to burrow through .	3
I hope you're not implying that the caucus shouldn't have a voice in international affairs .	1, 3
Does that make you more comfortable ? - Man :	8, 1, 2
Let me do that .	2
What do you expect of me ?	2, 4
Seems a shame to part company after all these years .	6
I'll never have a girl like that 	6
Major [PERSON] will arrange for whatever facilities you may require .	8
Why didn't you ask me ?	7
Sir , you have beaten my wife , and she has gone off with another man .	1
What's the problem ?	2
I'm going to call up [PERSON] now .	2
No , thank you . No , thanks .	1
I'm gonna do it alone !	8, 1
Nemo has won him over completely .	8, 5
Ho , ho ! - Ho ! - Ho , ho , ho !	5
It's wonderful .	5
Slaughter ! You missed !	3
[PERSON] - boy's got a little something personal to discuss with you .	4
[PERSON] , may I come in ?	2
God , it's in perfect shape .	5
But how do you live there all by yourself ?	7
He promised you parts in Cats ?	7
I don't feel so good .	6
No complaints .	5
You've caused me enough trouble already .	1
Their screams ... you never forget something like that .	1, 3, 4, 6
Yesterday they didn't even have a kid and now they have a seven - year - old .	7
Any more than I could on that night I saw [PERSON] for the last time .	6
Somebody must be in good humour .	5
It's just -- it's hard sometimes .	4, 6
Oh ... you should do it .	8, 2
Miss what ?	7
Consequently , you've been selected to hold the key position in the coming ' festivities .	8
I tell you somethin' .	1
The result of this is that we're in a crisis that is unacknowledged , ironically .	3, 7
What should I be afraid ?	4, 7
You know what to do .	8
I hadn't the heart to warn her .	6
Tomorrow ?	2
You wanted to find out who I'm working with .	2
You're running the risk of harming your children .	4
If this guy has any information , why hasn't he contacted you already ?	3, 7
Not the gondola , not the gondola .	4
That's why I do things ... to feel good .	5
We'll be in the station soon . You'll be safe when we get there .	2, 5
You never told me your father was ...	7
This is between ... me and him , and no one else .	1
Both ? - ( chuckles )	5
Put the man in the cauldron immediately	1
She'll be dead before the sound gets there .	4
Marry a girl your own age .	3
At the moment , no .	3
What are you doing here , [PERSON] ?	7
I want to see [PERSON] .	2
Come on ...	3
Yes .	8, 2, 5
We're gonna go camping tonight . - This is my tent .	2
And I said ...	2
Father , I'm at the end of my rope .	6
This is plain stubbornness and you know it .	1
You reject it .	6
No way in hell .	1, 3
Ms. [PERSON] ... everybody has a secret face .	7
There's no reason for me to be here .	6
Where's the bastard that runs this shithole ?	3
Get going , [PERSON] ! [PERSON] !	1
Take a couple , sir .	8
I'm gonna take you to a nice , quiet place .	8
You make me sick with your heroics .	3
Why aren't they over Diamond Head ?	7
A lot of people are going to pay for this night .	1
After them ! After them !	1, 2
It wouldn't have worked .	6
I have to go now .	7
It's incredible stupidity ...	1, 6, 7
But have you a safe big enough to hold this ?	8
Why are you looking at me ?	1
Am I interrupting something ?	7
Is not no one , who could take care of him ?	6
I am thinking of you .	5
Fuck you !	1, 3
She's very attractive , I know .	8, 2, 5
How about what the hell you're doing in there to begin with ?	1
All : Ohh , shit .	1, 4
I'll do what I can , Mammy .	8
Only when the weapons were used at [LOCATION] and [LOCATION] did the government disclose what they were .	1, 3, 6
Okay , I'm with you .	8, 5
What the hell is that ?	1, 3, 7
Thank you ! Yes !	8, 5
All right , not now , but you need to hear this .	1
[PERSON] , the funniest champion ever .	5
With [LOCATION] conquered , nothing can stand in our way .	2
It's not going to be a problem , is it , [PERSON] ?	4
Let me say the password .	8, 1
You should really count it , you know .	2
Well ? Where have you been ? Don't tell me you tried to call me back , because I know you did not .	1, 3, 6
I know him . She knows him .	8, 1
You're not dumb .	8
It can only blow up in our faces .	4
How ' bout it , handsome ?	2, 5
It's hard to believe , isn't it ?	7
This Chinese trade agreement is going to make [LOCATION] voters very happy .	2
I'm having friends in on Wednesday for dinner and drinks .	2
Mr who ?	7
You look lovely .	5
I will .	8, 2
You make things possible , Mr. [PERSON] , and I've been afraid for things to be possible . Miss [PERSON] , your check .	8
I won the damn title and they think I'm a bum !	1
In my mind's eyes I see three circles joined in priceless , graceful harmony .	5
Gentlemen , I have good news for you .	2, 5
You can tell him that for the both of us !	1
This office does not condone any racial epithets .	1
How's it taste ?	2, 7
I hope that while we're waiting , another disaster doesn't occur .	4
And he fought for them for the only reason any man ever fights for them .	8
Wipe first your chin , drunkard , and then the table !	3
I will watch over you .	8
I had met [PERSON] to ask his advice .	8
I saw it , but I didn't believe it .	7
Can we get there without being seen ?	4
Rocky , mind if I talk to you outside about a few things ?	4
We got a real mess here , man .	7
What a divine place .	5
It's just beginner's luck .	1, 6, 7
This should work , it's from Harvard .	8
I ought never to have married [PERSON] .	6
Light has conquered darkness .	5
Grab the hand rail !	7
God , it will be so good to be finished with all this .	2
It didn't feel to me like you were interested in talking just now .	6
I don't like this house .	1
You've done damage enough .	1
Why is she crying ?	6, 7
So if you're not busy , you want to go to a fraternity party ?	2
It seems to me very clear .	2
There must be something I can do .	6
Try me .	8, 1, 2
Ruby's been dead for 14 , years .	6
It is useless to ask .	1
But are they telling me , or are they asking me ?	7
One !	7
Yeah , well , we're going . - Not with you !	1, 7
Hold him !	1, 2
I got him sold , [PERSON] .	5
I'm going to join up with our brave lads in gray .	2
I'm going to tell you a funny story .	2
My uncle is a hard , unforgiving man .	4
Give me all the covering fire you can spare .	8
[PERSON] , you're a wonderful egg .	5
Did ya ? There was a razorback in my truck !	1
Intriguing young lady , Miss [PERSON] .	7
You can not come to the hospital , [LOCATION] .	6
This is my home !	8, 5
Here's to all that gorgeous snatch in FLA.	5
I can't tell you what a welcome sight this is .	5
But there is a problem .	1, 6
Oh , and that's as it should be .	5
That's the way to do it .	8
That telegram from [LOCATION] , why should you bother about it ?	1
I refuse to answer that question .	1, 6, 7
[PERSON] , are you OK ?	8, 4, 6, 7
Hey , [PERSON] , how about some beer ?	2
Where's that wonderful music coming from ?	7
Push ! Here it is ! Here it is !	8, 2, 5, 7
You're comfortable .	5
[PERSON] had her specialty . She imitated frogs .	5
What's this doin' in your ear ?	7
We're not winning this war .	4
You're doin' fine , you're doin' just fine .	8
When neither of them made the cut ,	1, 2
Look , a fist !	7
Well , give me a coordinate !	1, 2
Let's see what we have here for our guests .	2
We're the only ones who can afford to be honest .	1
It has happened to me without my wanting , almost without my knowing .	3
I've never been invisible before .	7
How'd you get in there ?	2, 7
It kills many brave men .	4
Hey , wait a minute !	1
You sound like a woman with a mission . I am .	7
We'll blow it open .	1
But you needn't go on account of this idiot .	3
Little [PERSON]'s been so lonely ...	6
It must be serious .	4
Well , that's not a very even trade .	7
Spring's gonna be early .	2
You think you're the only guy in this paw that wants out ?	1
You're not just a crook , but a murderer .	1, 3
There's been enough bloodshed already .	6
Where did she get a bag to match those shoes ?	2
It's been a long year .	6
Show me how to punish Perseus for this blasphemy !	3
I don't know what you're training ' for , but as far as I'm concerned , you're ready . Look !	8, 5
Well , I'm not going to leave him .	8
If I didn't know better , I'd think you didn't like it here .	8, 1
Ring it , mate .	2, 5
There he is !	2
This tureen holds as much sand as we had strawberries tonight .	3, 6
I know how much that hurts .	8
The most terrifying ever beheld by human eyes .	4
You protect a fruit stand , man , a shoeshine parlor , you know ?	7
Until a trial ... When she sees her husband suffer ... The way she never ...	3, 6
Well , I know you ain't confusing yourself with getting in shape to ride again .	3
Oh , man , you guys are the greatest !	5
How can we be sure she'll help us free the Childlike Empress ?	6
Hasn't God forgiven me , thanks to you ?	8
We could be rich , if you say the word .	2
They ain't gonna quit on me .  	8
How did you get to be a captain ?	3
God , you're probably right .	7
I'm just ... so frustrated .	1, 3, 6
We'll make an honest buck together .	8
Remember those commercials you did ?	2, 5
One more word and I'll cut you down !	1
I headed into the English old country Looking for help .	2, 4, 7
God , it's ugly here .	3
Try it yourself if you don't believe me .	8
They've done things with my body and the bodies of others ...	4
Excuse me . I know this is bad timing .	8
Another day or two , we'll know for sure who it is .	2
Are you sitting down ?	4
You couldn't have found anyone more sympathetic to your condition .	8
But , she can be very generous sometimes .	8, 2, 5
That is the most ridiculous thing I ever heard in my life .	1
Mr. [PERSON] , this is your son's girlfriend .	8, 1
Yes , but if we use it , we'll win .	8, 1, 2
Someone we know ?	7
What do you skin ?	2
Please , Lieutenant .	8
I. . .	4, 6
So , come on , give me the gun .	1, 2
No ! No ! No !	3, 4
You and [PERSON] make two nice goddesses .	5
Not a bad family to marry into .	5
[PERSON] , I'm just trying to help you .	8, 2, 4, 6
I'll let you know when I get it straightened out .	8
Isn't that wonderful ?	5
A lot of junk all right ...	1
Sing something , [PERSON] . Wonderful idea !	5
Stop !	1, 2, 4
For the first time , when we looked at each other in the gypsy camp , and again at the window at the casino , and again just now , when I held out my hand to you ,	8, 5
Sometimes , it makes the skin crawl .	4
You're my hero .	8
I don't believe you !	1
I don't wan na go like this .	6
What do you want ?	1, 2
That is true .	8
No unpleasantness , I hope .	8, 2, 4
Are you okay ?	4, 5, 6, 7, 8
I can see I made a mistake .	6

There's no place out there for graft or greed or lies , or compromise with human liberties .	5
If we let those bastards get dug in now , we'll have to level the building !	1
What do you mean , if anything happens to you ?	4
You know , they say the most vulnerable part of the human body ... is the throat ... and that you never really know how you feel about somebody ... until they have their hands around your throat .	4

[PERSON] is king .	8, 5
I have but one life ... and that life is all too short for me to fulfill that destiny .	6

Well , [PERSON] was very insistent that I should give you a call .	2
As you can see , I'm being relieved of command .	1, 2, 6
And it starts creating the specter of a threat .	4
You may call me Captain [PERSON] .	8
The old man was right after all !	7
Then don't say it .	1
There's nothing sweeter than sharing a secret with an enemy .	8
I said it , damn you .	1
Well , she wanted me to tell you that she's ... she's all right .	8, 5
You'll make a good living cow - thieving .	3

How about a nice mango [LOCATION] cooler ?	2, 5, 7
It's you .	4
You want fantasy , let's go to my place .	2
I do not even know who you are .	7
Do we give the impression of people who are pressed for money ?	1
A guy like me should never be allowed to get in here in the first place !	6
[PERSON] , are you all right ?	4

No ! We're extracting ! Give me the breaching charges !	1, 2
I wanted to hurt a pimp . That's what I wanted to do .	1, 3, 6
Looks like the Lord sends me about every misery he can think of just to try my soul .	6
( sighs ) I thought I got some good news .	6
Listen , [PERSON] , why don't you come down with us ?	2
Why's she making those funny noises ?	7

You stay out of this .	1
I admit I was nervous .	4

But , in a democracy , we do not shoot unarmed suspects on sight for a murder in which their participation is still unproven .	3
Hurry up , students . Five more minutes for your pen - pals .	2
Just relax for a minute and then tell me all about it .	8
My champagne is not properly cooled .	3

I bet you're starving to death .	6
Don't point that fucking thing at me . Take it off .	1, 3
I'm not very good at that .	6
Oh , him and his wife splitting up ?	6
If it's so nutritious , how come I don't see you eating it ?	3
And if they try to , they'll find you dead .	1
That I'm going to be okay .	5
I - I came to this country to pursue the American dream .	4
You mean to tell me you wear a different dress for different times of the day ?	7
I'm in the shithouse .	3
He's a friend of mine .	8
You damn near broke my arm .	1, 3
Maybe we're about to find out .	4
Of course it's been a great trial to your patience , Father ... but think of the burden that it's been to me .	6
Your boy is sicker than we know .	4
It is so nice to be here .	5
All I ever do is try to please you	6
What do I do , Bloomy ?	4, 6
That's my old man , Kid .	8, 5
What about the herd ?	7
What about if they engage us ?	4
I'm afraid Scraps will have to be shot .	6
Goodbye , [PERSON] !	5, 6
No , the flight must be stopped .	4
Are you sure you really love me ?	4
Now why don't you drop that tree you're holding and let's grab a vine and swing a little , huh ?	2
Then you ought to understand why I can't .	8
You're hopelessly outnumbered	4
Your observations will greatly influence public opinion ,	8, 2
Heaven knows how she lived through those weeks .	6
I don't want you saying nothing about the Kid and nobody else in my damn county .	1
They're coming to kill you !	4
Slow down or you'll get a ticket !	4
Incredible .	7
And your love .	5
You treat her bad .	3
Fuck .	1
I really am nice , but you act like a fool around me .	6
You see what he did to Miss [PERSON]'s shirt ?	1, 3, 6
I didn't mean to ruin your evening .	6
He said : Just leave the money in the top drawer .  	6
I have suffered a few myself -- but we are in this together .	1, 2, 5, 6
I'm such a pain in the ass these days I deserve myself .	3
This is the bridal suite ?	7
Come on , come on , come on .	1
These things just are not made for long rides . Nice set of wheels .	5
You can show me your tan .	2
You can't hold me without a warrant .	1
I'll make sure your journey is safe	8
Help !	4, 7
My face and my body have aged .	6
The press release said that you were taking a leave to consider your career options .	2, 5
Come on . Are we doing this again ?	1
Didn't the formula cure his rheumatism ?	7
Do you accuse me , Mr. [PERSON] ?	1
Anyhow , I'm sick a human life was lost .	1
Then what did you just stuff under your bed ? Nothing .	4
Are we supposed to just sit here and wait ?	1
Love , charm , and violence .	2
I need a drink .	2
Except blurt out a total confession .	5
I know all the other teams laugh at me .	6
Request permission to leave . - Captain , sir ?	2, 4
It must be difficult to let go of something so beautiful .	6, 7
It's too late for that , [PERSON] .	6
You gonna invite us in ?	1
This train can't wait .	1
Are we ready ?	2
Only those I trust know that .	8
Found hair in your comb .	3
Actually , I kissed you because I couldn't control myself	8, 5
That's no good .	3
This is paradise .	5
If you're guides there , I'll kill your family .	1, 4
But after all , you're the logical man from the [LOCATION] for the national ticket .	8
See , she didn't even have probable cause .	1
Where the hell do you think you're going ?	1
Everybody !	5
In this order we're not allowed personal possessions . Nor are we .	1
And , [PERSON] , I want you to get me the CEO of IBC ASAP .	2
You can't buy people's souls .	1, 3
Take him !	1, 3
He shouldn't be a cop .	6, 7
I took a sabbatical , and I traveled . But no matter where I went , The memory of that awful night	6
We're here to talk about the online lucrative sale of [LOCATION]'s children for sex , which in our experience occurs most prominently	8, 6
Jealousy can be destructive .	6
Yeah , you're just kidding .	1
What kind of mission ?	7
From then on I was hopelessly lost .	6
You've been served .	1, 2
I've been having weather problems .	6
If you have something to say , say it and get out .	1
Hey , look at this , guys .	7
There she went !	2
Please just look at me .	2, 6
Who was so interested ?	7
But I will come back .	2
We were so very sorry about your father .	6
It can not sit down in wet cushions .	3
My job is to see that big , strong men like you ... get on these buses without getting lost .	3
This fucking guy's scaring me .	4
I also know about the stakeouts , the tailings , the video cassettes .	4, 7
You need a somebody .	8
Lincoln just ain't the same no more .	6
I've seen men rape an old crippled woman in a wet ditch .	3
An end to the human race that has plagued this pretty planet for far too long .	3
I'm giving the bride away .	8
How did eggs get into the conversation ?	7
Well , there it is .	7
What if they catch the Captain before he gets help ?	4
Well , if his books are any indication , he has lived quite a life .	7
If you wouldn't mind giving me a lift .	8
We have to keep on what we've been doing and break him .	1
I think a little mood lighting is appropriate .	2
We've been through this !	1
Wonderful ! What's it say , honey ?	2
They're right .	8
We just found out they were lost !	4
Transmission's weak .	4
Look ... I don't know who you people are , but I saved the child's life , didn't I ?	1
This is what it is , [PERSON] .	3, 6
My clothes !	1
It doesn't make sense .	6
Where'd you get it ?	2
And he calls me an asshole !	3
[PERSON] , if you weren't with me , I never woulda done as good .	8, 5
This is quite a setup they have here .	7
I'm hurt and ...	6
I'm not kiddin' around .	8, 1
Please don't do this to me .	4, 6
Sure , but that's good , too .	5
That surprises me even more .	7
Honestly , sometimes I don't understand you at all .	1
Hi , [LOCATION] . Can you put [PERSON] back on , please ?	2
I thought it my duty to warn you .	8
Take your hands off !	1
I know you ... you murdering son of a bitch .	1, 3
What !	7
And when the shooting starts ... she'll be there to look after the girls .	8
It had to be filled with love .	2, 5
What's [PERSON] got to do with this ?	7
Okay ? You're gonna check in with me on a nightly basis .	5, 7
It's just not that cute anymore .	1
Oh , here you are ...	6, 7
That night I got a grip on life again .	5
You haven't got a little nip of something , have you ?	8
I get to never see my parents again or my loved ones .	6
You mean , he has a key to your home ?	7
She's a pretty little thing , isn't she ?	5
Nice day , huh ?	5
l got lost .	6
You make me feel uncomfortable .	4
It's too late .	4
Don't be a fool , woman .	3
He got what he wanted .	7
Hell !	1
I also understand that I care very much what happens to you .	8
I'll be right there .	8
You fear you'll not always love me ?	4
Disgust that somebody she'd looked up to could be so weak .	6
[PERSON] , my dear !	5, 7
[PERSON] said to tell the old man - I'm sorry , sir , the captain - that he'd better start thinking about a tow .	4
She tried to kill me because I told her about Nately .	4
Shut up , you fuckhead !	1
[PERSON] , open your fucking eyes !	1
I've been aching to mention it to you .	2
Why don't you back the hell off of her ?	1
And that's the most gorgeous thing I ever saw .	5
That's fine .	8
You're not tired .	8
The boy's doing so poor these days , why not take him along and air him ?	6
I'll take care of you .	8
I'm delighted .	5
Because it was my misery .	6
Here he comes .	2, 4
I hate you !	1
Oh , [PERSON] , I'm frightened .	4
My mother and dad'll help us , I'm sure they will .	8
I used to drive a tank when I was in the army , but look at me now !	1
You don't park here either .	1
We tried that route , but we gave up .	6
No , no , no , I don't mean that .	7
Most people will feel good riddance .	2
It's time .	5
I don't want to .	1, 6
Sometimes I think you don't even know I live here .	6
Good British plugs .	8, 2, 5
You won't stay here , and I can't go with you .	6
Don't show it to me .	1
Mayii : I had long since lost track Of the child [PERSON] .	6
Now come on !	1
Would you like to dance ?	2
As things are , there's no need for you to go through the Customs .	8
This is so embarrassing .	3
You had a shot in Public Domain where you looked at the camera , into me and I loved you .	5
[PERSON] , what's happenin' here ?	7
I'm going after her .	4
I'm burning .	4
All right , I will !	1
Shouldn't we be going ?	1
Stop , you !	1
What's going on ? We need to talk . That's all .	1, 3
What's the matter with your arm ?	2, 7
I'm doing everything in my power not to fire you .	8, 1, 3
I'd be so happy if that were really true , [PERSON] .	6
Listen , I've always returned favors , haven't I , [PERSON] ?	6
Designed to make your life a more annoying place to be .	1
Um , I found someone else to -- to take your room ,	3
Oh , come on , it's just a joke .	7
You are in trouble !	1
Sorry , pal .	6
And it's about you , and it's about [PERSON] , and it's about the drinking , and it's about all of it .	1
And a right good one .	5
People with money like uniforms .	1, 3
But , you see , if this thing here controls you , it's gonna burn you and everythin' else around you up . That's right .	4
In the interest of the West's greatest horse , the bronco and myself , who grows them , I'm putting up an extra $ 1,000 , to the bronco rider who wins !	2
Get me some punch .	2
Why are you so good to us ?	7
We're in trouble now .	4
Why don't you tell the voters what you really plan on doing with this town ?	1
[PERSON] , what the fuck took you so long ?	1
But I couldn't help noticing , despite the habit , that you're quite young .	7
I smell blood .	4
That stuff will knock your socks off .	2
Well ... I guess that means that you and I have gone From being friends to being enemies .	3, 6, 7
I'll never eat fish again .	3
Let's have it .	1, 2
It was fine . You've been away all this time ?	7
How about the three of you shaking hands ?	8
Just give me five minutes .	2
Make yourself comfortable .	8
I'm a little low on maple syrup , but I got plenty of raspberry jam , which , you know , a lot of people prefer .	2, 5
Was it you ?	1, 7
Oh , how I have longed to hold this child .	5
The solutions to [LOCATION]'s urgent and long - term potential problems are there .	2
You need to tell us you understand .	8
I know I don't have to do it but I want to .	6
Yeah , I'm aware of that . And they have all of them .	1, 2, 4
For me , the fun went out of it after [PERSON] died . It was never any good , really , after that .	6
The fire went out !	5
Good ?	7
You just do what I tell you from now on , [PERSON] .	1, 2
I just had the weirdest dream .	7
That is bullshit .	1, 3
He's not coming back .	4, 6
You won something , did you ?	2, 7
Some days I wake up --	4, 6
If I had a Luger ...	1
Chill or die , asshole .	1
Mr. [PERSON] , that sounds like a threat .	4
It was a pleasure .	5
I'm [PERSON] , sir .	4, 7
What would you do if it was your child ?	6, 7
[PERSON] ?	2, 4, 7
You've convinced me that you're a philanderer of the very first order .	8
[PERSON] , I'm in paradise .	5
Enough !	1
Yes , but he's in his office ... [PERSON] , can you believe this ? They just faxed me the chewgood numbers .	5
You're not gonna believe this .	7
Up yours !	1, 3
Yeah , okay , judge [PERSON] . ( Laughs ) What does judge [PERSON] have to do with it ?	2
You were right .	8, 4, 7
That cunt is no good .	3
I did not want to miss that .	6
They'll kill you .	4
All of a sudden , there's a lot of noise .	7
What was what ?	7
And now , what are we going to do ?	2
Yeah , yeah , yeah ...	1, 2, 3
Yeah ? The last time you assured me , I lost good men in the [LOCATION] .	1, 3, 6
Please guide us	2
You shot Mr. [PERSON] !	7
We've come to wish you gladness .	5
She's a very agreeable child , you'll see .	2
I loved you for it , just as my father did .	5
Christ . I don't know what you've been up to , but [PERSON] is pissing fire .	1, 4
Of course I'm talking about Delta , you twerp !	1
You can do it , buddy .	2, 5
Get us some frickin' pretzels or something .	1
Do what he says :	1, 4
Do you wish me to translate [PERSON]'s letter or not ?	1
Who took the Scotch from my closet ?	1
Probably turned into some potluck , poster - making , sing - along .	3, 7
You realize your contacting the saucer violated our instructions .	1
Acts of homicide and cannibalism reported through the afternoon are contributable , at least in part , to these reactivated bodies .	1, 6
And guess what ? We're coming to see you tomorrow .	8, 5
Your daughter's getting prettier every day , [PERSON] .	5
I'm sorry , gentlemen , but the order is final .	1
I'm not coming .	3
It was blocking him from coming out .	6
I intend to .	2
Thank you for using ATT .	8
There's a man down there on his head .	4
Hey , these are keen !	7
I'm not playing at being provost marshal . And I never heard of luck that didn't run out .	1, 6
What have I done now ?	4
We've been ambushed by the very forces That you wish to trade with .	1, 3
When I left her she was alive !	4
It does feel better to get it out .	5
[PERSON] must not be a prisoner , Chief executive .	8
Have you thought for a moment about her ?	1, 3
All right , but let me know what you're doing .	2
This is an unscheduled surprise .	7
Well , that's easy .	5
And then they'll kill us !	4
They breed like rabbits , don't do any work and expect Welfare to put them on [LOCATION] .	1, 3
You're breaking my fucking arm ! - Hurry !	1, 2, 4
Sure . For five bucks .	2
The reason you never take your wallet out at a ball game or anyplace else is that someone's gonna steal it from you .	4
I think [PERSON] will win .	8, 2
I haven't had a job in four months .	6
[PERSON] , did you know that your dad two - steps ? Really ?	7
Are you any different ?	2
We don't like [PERSON] .	1
You are just one too many !	1
Mr. [PERSON]'s changed with the times .	7
It's your decision , but if you make it you'll be no good to yourself or anybody else .	1
How did we ever stand each other in that plane for three years during the war ?	7
Yeah , I mind .	1
Did you do it ?	7
Everybody else laughs at it , but not you .	7
We're trying to help ya !	8
You're sure of that , are you ?	7
It's a lot of time , especially when it stands still with loneliness .	6
[PERSON] turns against me , And I should lighten up ?	1
Has decided to demolish ...	6
Oh my , where are my manners ?	8
I want to tell you something .	8
I unfortunately have to say that [PERSON]'s legal strategy has been very effective .	1, 4
I'm gonna take him back to the orphanage .	3
If you wan na survive , you got ta slip the jab .	8
When they looked back , they saw the body of Little Man lie down among his friends .	6
To have an ugly incident occur while we're on this train with no method of escape that is not in our self - interest , either .	1, 4
Is that what you wanted ?	7
I spend time with them , yeah .	2, 5
We're unbeatable .	5
I would call ... revenge .	1
No , listen .	1
Woman , go on about your business .	3
Don't listen to her !	4
Hey , lighten up !	8, 2, 5
Please don't say that .	1
The coach was robbed and [PERSON] killed .	4
Don't open that door , [PERSON] .	4
No sweat .	8
It is so nice to meet you .	5
But until then , Mr Boot , you'll get yourself the best newspaperman you ever had .	8
A very good man .	5
[PERSON] , make them pipe down .	1
That bridge would collapse under the first train .	4
She's flying straight to [LOCATION] to be with her father ?	7
That was very considerate of him .	8
One of the reasons you get to people is you pay 'em .	8
And then one day I went into the barn ... and there he was .	2, 3, 7
Do not ruin kamoja .	1, 3
You watch me .	8, 2
God , forgive me .	6
I tried one of them once , but she didn't show any enthusiasm at all .	6
We'll have to find new opportunities .	2
They're gonna need a fucking wrecking ball to take me out of here .	1
This horse is a running motherfucker . - No , shit . - Yeah .	7
I won't go schizo , will I ?	4
Good morning , Mr. President .	8, 2
Come on , man .	6, 7
For being the biggest dickhead I ever went out with .	3
The sword was her husband's .	8
Goddamn little bitch secretary .	3
Are you sure they're here ?	2
Now , your gallant Maj. [PERSON] is selling me a phony . So he deserves whatever he gets .	1, 3
All you need now is a divorce , and your dreams of [PERSON] can come true .	2
She is right .	8
She is the most immoral young lady I have ever seen .	3
I'm really glad to meet you . - Mr. [PERSON] .	8, 5
You got our package back , man .	5, 7
No way .	8
Oh , you just left her ?	6, 7
It's as if ordinary human beings , living ordinary lives , had suddenly vanished from the [LOCATION] , and the world was suddenly full of butterflies shaped like people .	7
No . Wait .	2
Nothing .	1, 6
Oh , boundless heaven and earth Help me !	4
Altitude ? - Altitude . You want some altitude ?	1
Here they come !	2
I mean , it wasn't a bad little table .	6
Now he'll be able to have everything he's always wanted and couldn't afford .	2
You're gonna make me swear on the Bible ?	4
What a nasty man .	3
Smoke , fire , oppressive heat , as Colombian and Jamaican drug fiends again transform [LOCATION] into a slaughterhouse .	3
Wait a minute , I'm ahead of you .	7
I didn't know ... that she was in trouble .	6
Then , you know you've got a shitty witness .	1, 3
We need an IV right now !	7
You know , you could pay me . That's one way to break the ice . Oh , yeah , I'm sorry .	1
But . .	6, 7
Two years ago , you asked my father my hand .	5
C'mon , rest awhile girl .	4, 6
I'll give you a cigar . All right .	5
Who the hell asked you anyways , huh ? - Shut up !	1
Now , there was a possible sighting two days ago in the [LOCATION] .	2
Then take my advice .	8
And in that , you will be essential , mon ami .	8, 2, 5
So you do not recognize me ?	6, 7
Snap out of it ! He took my [PERSON] !	1
I think I've finally found a sport I like .	5
Beautiful morning .	5
He likes to kick the shit out of white trash like you , boy .	3
Ooh ! Oh ! In the name of the holy father ,	5
You were terribly in love with her .	8, 5, 6
Whoops .	4
I don't claim to be some kind of brilliant psychologist .	1
Hey , that's got a nice ring to it , kid .	5
What's all this for ?	7
Forget it , that's enough .	1, 6
Darling , he'll never be able to support you .	4
Don't look at me with those soft - boiled eggs .	1
Of course I'm sweating , you moron .	3
He's one of the twins and not what you call completely there .  	4
How do you take it ? Ah , just like that .	2
What intelligent devils !	8
Are you kidding ?	1, 7
I don't think she's intelligent either .	3
And as long as you've got this wedding ring on , you've got me .	8
So welcome to Elysian Fields .	5
Not you . Not Agent [PERSON] . Me .	6
But you make one slip , just one and we'll see how long you survive in my cage .	1, 2
[PERSON] , why don't you take your coat off and stay awhile ?	2
I'm glad to hear that .	5
Did you tell him what a great success it was ?	5
The Presidential Commission has empowered me to take it in my care .	8
He stepped in front of a bullet for me once caught it in his left hand and shoved it up the punk's ass .	3, 7
Don't you want to say anything to these people ?	1, 2
I never thought I'd see the day . Will you move over June , I can't see my knockout of a granddaughter ?	6
I slaved for you for over ten years without even a raise or a promotion .	1, 6
There are you , free to come and go as you please , and you choose to stay here .	7
I view with alarm the influence over you of this Bolshevik lady .	4
Out there , you got me a little wrong .	7
You got something to say about our plan ?	1
Just put on your coat .	1
Waiting for an answer .	2
I really need your help , Mr [PERSON] .	8, 4, 5
Go away .	1
He's come for the king . - You snake !	3
You've got a gun .	7
It looks very nice on you .	5
Well , we're there for the oil . Let's not pretend .	1, 3
You got my respect and silence , [PERSON] , okay ?	8, 1, 4
You got ta be a real putz to wear a white coat around here .	3
Grown - up men playing with monkeys .	3
The monster ?	4, 7

How did it go , [PERSON] ?	2, 5
I love [PERSON] .	8, 5
Happy ? !	1, 3, 6
You don't know ?	1, 2
Uh ... Yes ? No offense , but I think	1, 2
It's a small part , but the producer said the next picture I'll have a bigger part .	2
But I believe what the prosecutor said .	8
Glad you liked it , Grandfather .	5
What I say is , why go on living with them if they can't stand them ?	7
I will have no dealings with the Grand Duchess nor her representative .	1
We thought they might be weapons directed against us .	4
You may believe what you like .	1
Please don't cry anymore .	6
Subject is violently antisocial given to delusions of godhood . And he's hopelessly addicted to narcotics .	6
You better have something for me .	2
You want to know something interesting ?	8
Some of you think you can outsmart me .	8, 1
Did you remember to get my dress ?	2
[PERSON] hits the ceiling and throws me out .	6
Like hell it isn't .	1
Then I'll take her when you're dead !	1
I think I do .	8, 5
What the hell are we doing here ?	1
He got a little sick .	6
That was good .	5
You didn't know he's back ?	7
♪ The colors of the rainbow ♪	5
You're afraid of what may happen if the war comes ?	4
Mr. [PERSON] ... put the ball away and sit down !	1
And yet with all that ... they still want to try it again ?	4
Whatever I was , that was a long time ago .	6
How come you adopted me ?	2
You disapprove , sir ?	6, 7
I've always thought a lashing with a whip would benefit you immensely .	3
Wasn't that wonderful ?	5
I can't stand this spic shit .	1, 3
What if he kills [PERSON] ?	2, 4
You got to kill him , [PERSON] , now !	1
As part of this amnesty it will not be necessary for officers to do manual labour .	5
I'm sorry for what happened .	8, 4, 6
You've made no protests yourself ?	7
In hospital he'd hide cigars and brandy all over the place .	3
It would have been deliciously wicked .	5
It was a pleasure to have the general here .	5
I didn't say that .	1
Which future has God , if there is a God , chosen for man's destiny ?	4
You're out of your mind . - The prosecutor will explain everything when you see him .	1
Condition Zebra alert .  	4, 7
[PERSON] , I thought you'd be amused .	2, 7
Now it's all one big mess .	6
Mr. [PERSON] , the man is honest . I can trust you .	2, 5
Get in the car .	1
Take this and start a new life for yourself . Somewhere off this bus , okay ?	8, 5, 6
I want you to stay on the civil case .	8
You don't get it , do you ?	1, 3
Much obliged !	8
Cause we just got a package , and I don't see his address here in the ...	4, 7
I just can't believe [PERSON]'s dead .	6, 7
What a place to be stuck .	4, 7
Very funny . Oi , oh , officer .	5
UFOs are as real as the planes flying over your head .	8
I love champagne .	5
So do you draw all the dads and their kids ?	2
Screw the captain .	1
It was an accident .	4
Let's go to bed .	2
So , a rose is not a rose , and an umbrella has nothing to do with rain .	7
Good to see you again , friend .	5
But I'll meet you at the [LOCATION] movie theatre .	2
They made me mad .	1
Now is as good a time as any to learn .	2, 4, 5
I saw her just once more after that wedding night .	6
[PERSON] , look out for the Red Car !	4
And if you don't understand plain English ... maybe there's something else you will understand .	3
You don't bring enough men with you .	4
Well , sweetie , it's tomorrow .	2
Y' all ready to go camping ?	2
How much simpler it would be , for so many of us , if [PERSON] had not found it necessary to look for a new face .	1
What do you say we all dance ?	2, 5
How did [PERSON] and the newspapers get the [PERSON] story before you ?	7
You came up here to kill me , didn't you ?	4
You know he's got the missiles . I know he's got the missiles .	1
Our prayers were answered .	5
Tried to save a girl , kind of queered his mind too .	1
The Navy can't do without me here , the island might sink !	1, 4
She must've struck something .	5

[PERSON] , anybody who's got two fists and a good heartbeat , they got a chance .	2
Your whore .	1, 3
I don't think so and I don't care and I don't have the time .	1
May I ask you a question ?	2
What'd you do with the one you killed ? I hid the body .	8, 4
He'd kill you if he heard you .	1, 4
You better come back .	8, 2, 4, 6
Can it be that I'm falling in love with you ?	7
I know how this city degrades the individual .	2, 3, 6
I'd like to know why I'm being shot .	4
I'll talk to you later .	2
The devil himself !	3, 4
If you ever talk to me like that again ... I'll make sure you never win another election in your life .	3

Of what it is of use ?	2
You must never do anything like that again , ever .	1
Ready for testing .	2
Let's stay just a little longer .	2
And what point is that ?	1
I love him .	5
But what's wrong with Sister [PERSON]'s habit ?	7
Get out .	1
This is terrible .	6
Faced with that ... regardless of my personal feelings for the boy , my sense of duty told me that his expulsion from the Senate was the only possible answer .	6
They sent you . - What ?	7
Fine ! But I'm not making a speech .	8, 1, 4
He ain't gonna put out bucks on a lousy pair .	1, 3
I didn't ride out here to pick blueberries .	1
Are you all right ?	8, 4
I want one ! Cuts along on a jolly clip too , doesn't she ?	2, 7
Best you go ask him yourself .	2
Behold the [LOCATION] for all seasons !	2, 7
Just sit back there , relax , and enjoy life .	5
They're malicious and vicious , so in and out fast .	3
Just about a year ago in [LOCATION] , [LOCATION] . It was quite a night .	5

How long must we wait here ?	2
She eats !	7
I want some more beer .	2
Give us a statement ! Dozens are dead .	1, 3, 6
That's the boy's weak spot !	3
You don't like what you're doing ?	7
Well , it was nice , wasn't it ?	5
A guy who was a pain in the neck even before I carried his stuff .	1
All right . I've heard enough . I've heard enough .	1, 3
Shh . Somebody's out there .	4
And I stormed out .	1
I like [PERSON] , because I always know where he stands .	5
Did I spend 9 , years with matadors not to learn about fear and safety ?	1
I offered the dough because I wanted to thank you .	5
Was it so difficult ?	7

You thought I was in this for the money , [PERSON] ?	7
Do tell me more about her .	2
Wait !	2, 4, 7
And don't mess with nobody's girlfriend .	8, 1
How did this happen ?	7
My point is there is a protocol with the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children .	8, 1
Now you're talking sense .	8
Don't touch me .	1, 3
There must be a reason for this .	8
We won't leave this palace alive .	6

Makes rude gestures at people doing their socialist duties .	3

This material doesn't correspond to anything on the periodic table .	2, 7
These are death row inmates !	4
Hurry up .	1, 2
The witness stand is a lonely place to lie .	6
I'm sorry we got here too late to see you dance .	3, 6
Can you imagine that guy ?	7
Don't worry , Mama , we'll find them .	8
Rocky , no !	1, 4
If you want to cite law , then obey it yourself .	1, 3
That was the night [PERSON] went away .	6
No , please , wait !	6
Is that right , Shooter ?	1
What's it to you if I brought a woman , a man or a fuckin' Muscovy duck ?	1
You got old .	3, 6
I'm feeling fine this morning .	5
Who gave you this idea ?	1
Be a good fellow and get out now .	1
Mr. [PERSON] , there's a message from Mr. [PERSON] .	8
Anybody would be ashamed of that .	3
[PERSON] , don't you remember ?	7
By the way ...	4
Why don't you just let us get on with our job ?	1
[PERSON] , you fucking worm !	1, 3
I was at home with my baby mother !	1
All my powers have gone .	6
Now , with such simplicity ... Such clarity , everything falls into place .	6
What's the matter with you , [PERSON] ?	1
You asked for second helpings .	1
[PERSON] ? What kind of a name is that ?	1
I guess this must seem pretty pathetic to a guy like you .	6
My back is getting bad .	6
Alright , here's how it works ....	2, 5
Fucking come on , then !	1
It's bad there .	4
For if I'm not physician , how is it I know that you're a dying man ?	1
Cos whatever you got up there , I'm gonna find it out .	2, 3
You know , we knew you was a punk then , but you're being a punk now .	1, 3, 7
I tell you , gentlemen , we have a problem on our hands .	4
Yes , sir , that is some good joke .	5
Just to tell you that I'm happy .	5
Francis !	1
I have the satisfaction that all her pictures have been stinkers since I stopped writing them .	1, 3
Carry on , men .	8, 2
Sweetheart , what are you doing home ?	1, 2, 4, 7
You're lying !	3
My wife , God rest her soul , died years ago to the day .	6
I think maybe he'll listen to you .	8
There's nothing more wonderful than children playing , hearing them laughing .	8, 2, 5
Who are you and what do you want ?	4
What'd you just say ?	7
They're lovely .	5
It's good coffee .	5
We're playing with fire .	2, 4
Man your battle stations !	2
This is what I'd like to have someday .	2
When I came here , I thought this was gonna be a 30 - day stretch , maybe 60 .	7
That's what makes it so good afterwards .	5
[PERSON] ! We're family !	7
Of all things to keep secret , the fact that there is this bountiful option that we have of reaching out into the stars and being friendly neighbors with other civilizations in sharing information , and sharing resources , and sharing knowledge , and sharing spiritual insights and values .	8, 5
Well , here's to , uh ... community property .	8
He hit me .	1, 3
Launch sweep gear .	1, 2
I've got you the assignment of your dreams !	2, 5
Now , it will go under in to hours .	8, 2
Maryk showed me a log he had written on [PERSON]'s behaviour .	7
Hurry up , suckers , you're dragging !	3
Holy [PERSON] .	7
They laugh and kiss , then they scream and beat each other .	7
I'm talking too much .	6
It is time for the Torlato - Favrinis to get off the world .	1, 3
Uh ... anything for you , you sweet little muffin .	8, 5
What do you think they're all talking about ,	2
Stay there and don't move !	1
What were they counting on ?	7
I'll put in for a transfer .	2
I don't see how you have the gall to face me !	1
A dollar's a dollar , and every dollar is taking me further West .	2
I'm going to be out here if you need me .	8
That woman as the equal of man is entitled to equality before the law .	1
You're not gonna give him a chance , are you ?	4
Nobody move . This is a bust .	1
I remembered why I loved paintings in the first place , what got me into this .	5
Does anything ever happen here ?	1
My father's in the hospital again .	6
It's a miracle .	7
You know , holding that baby in your arms for the first time ... it changes your life .	5
Couldn't we have something brought in on trays like big executives ?	2
Ow ! Don't run in the hallways !	1, 7
Wouldn't this be faster ?	7
It was horrible there .	4
Burn this !	1, 3, 4
All my friends will be there .	2
I'm in an awful hurry .	4
My scarf . Where's my -- ?	7
Looks like you're gonna owe us some money , fat boy .	3
If I hurry , perhaps I might even be home in time for tea .	2
I just can't seem to throw anything out .	3, 6
I wanted to congratulate you .	8, 2
He's dead and buried , [PERSON] .	6
It's too stupid . Perhaps .	6
Alas ... Scalpel .	1, 2
That was the hope .	5
I apologise for his appointment .	6
I want you to look after me .	8
Enter !	1
First [PERSON] , now [PERSON] .	6
Or - or maybe you mean embarrassing the badge .	4
Why is it that you know so much about them ?	7
This is only the tip of the iceberg , as hundreds more have given us their testimony , but are too fearful to go on camera for fear of repercussions for themselves and for their families .	6
Herb ?	2, 7
If you know where she is , I beg you to tell me now before it's too late .	4
Thank you , baby .	8, 5
Tonight ? No , no . No feathers .	7
Take me home .	2, 6
She told about a mother who was full of hate , and how she got back the hate she gave .	6
Ain't no harm in being sociable .	5
Catholic school . A little minor league ball , long enough to find out I couldn't hit a curve .	6
I was in a shop once , and I saw a postcard with a beautiful house on it , right by the sea .	5
Yes , he loves you .	5
I'm obsolescing like this old straw - bottomed cruiser of ours .	6
We'll find out someday .	2
Kiddo !	5
Yes , of course .	8
There are things that you could do .	2
A force of nature capable of giving rise to all things wicked ?	4
How can I make you believe me ?	2, 6
I don't mean to be handing you no line , but that's pretty hard to believe .	7
You know Mr. [PERSON] and Mr. [PERSON] from before ?	7
Life back over there is hard .  	6
He's gonna kill you !	4
You'd think it was her own life she was fighting for .	2
Hundred dollars a night ?	7
It's all right , Colonel [PERSON] , they're friends .	8
Now he's living in , his wife just bought half of [LOCATION] [LOCATION] and I'm sitting here pulling my putz .	1, 3
They don't know he's here , do they ?	7
I'm so sorry , grandma . No one wanted to tell you , but you're dying .	6
You all right ?	2, 4, 6, 7
They'd give me ten to twenty years !	4
I think you know everybody here .	8
or something ? - Fuck ! - [PERSON] .	7
Well , I'm going to make this a week you'll never forget .	2
Break every mirror in the palace .	1
Try the basement .	2
Four degrees down !	5
[PERSON] , you remind me of someone I used to know .	7
Goodbye , boys .	6
Our kids , struggling through their lives .	6
I worked for you .	4, 6
Damn it , get in here !	1
They tell me you're quite a stud player , young man .	8, 2
I'm sorry , Rock .	6
This girl appears from nowhere . Now she's talking to this guy . That's a little convenient , don't you think ?	4, 7
Who cares where he's going anyway ?	1
Don't text me .	1, 3
Your boat , my boat .	8
I'll follow you .	8
Aren't you going to introduce me to your friend ?	2
Is this how it goes ?	7
Mr. [PERSON] was a major donor on Will's campaign .	8, 5
You don't believe that stuff , do you ?	7
Show yourself , come on !	4
Want a transfer back to PT boats ?	2
There'll be other dinners , [PERSON] .	2
But you're going to be all right .	8, 5
Anybody for buying a round ?	2
Now come on , you've been drinking .	1
Find someone else to sing about .	1
Wait a minute now .	7
She busted out in a Vegas faro game .	1
Oh , [LOCATION]'s top of the pops these days .	8, 5
Well , I'm feeling great .	5
There must be somewhere in [LOCATION] where one can find sanctuary to think .	1, 3
Am I a criminal for that ?	4
Well , we want our dough .	2
You made the appointment without me .	1
By the time they're done shitting ' their pants , I'm long gone , right ?	8
It was my scarf .	8
I want them to pay for it .	1
Brandy for me .	5
Find out anything ?	2
You're kinda that type yourself .	1
You look like a man of property .	8
You can't .	8, 1, 4
Very well .	8
I know everything , [PERSON] .	1, 3
Hello !	2, 5
It's a crime against the people who sent me here !	1
You think you're my boss ?	1, 3, 7
What about him ?	7
My heart behaved like a fool .	6
Wait a minute .	1
Aren't you human ?	1
It's a fucking slaughter , Lieutenant .	6
The officers of the [PERSON] in happy celebration .	5
I'm not at my best over the phone .	6
No sense taking any chances in this thing .	4
I just took care of him .	8
Guard them with your life .	8
Come on , then .	2
Shut up .	1, 3
You ... bitch !	1
Let me be the judge of that .	1
I'm pleased to meet you .	5
No , I told you I don't wan na do that anymore .	1
I knew we'd be all right .	5
He's touched .	5
But it did leave them to be BFFs .	5, 7
I think we should talk .	4
I want a monster truck .	2
Until last year , when he met a British publisher who spoke to his heart .	8, 2
Wear 'em on your collar .	1
A couple months in solitary will cool you off , bugger .	3
No one picked on you , [PERSON] .	1
God , I love you !	5
I'll miss that man .	6
This presumptuous little flirtation is over .	3
Now you got money in the bank and a faithful husband .	5
They were sailors , same as me ... Slaughtered by that monster You're tryin' to make friends with .	1, 3
I really appreciate that .	8
Uh ... we're just gonna do nothing ?	7
I like being with him and I like thinking about him .	5
Then I guess it's in God's hands now .	4
Do you know that my first trip to [LOCATION] took five days ?	7
For a buck , you get a shooter , and a cigar , and a dance with the beautiful bride .	5
If a sorcerer's house isn't his castle , what is it ?	1, 2, 4, 7
You might as well dump it !	1
When I think yours has given you , Village ... as a vulgar , without dowry .	3
[PERSON] , I'm gonna be sick . I'm sorry .	3, 6
[PERSON] , I wondered who ate these damn things .	3, 7
They're fucking animals .	3
I broke my heel on my shoe .	6
I can't stand it anymore .	6
Yes , Commissioner .	8, 7
Hi , [PERSON] . I'm sorry I didn't get to send you a card yet about your wife .	6
Yeah , going public will not help you , or me .	2, 4
We must act immediately , tonight !	2, 7
You've seen it and read it a thousand times .	3
And everybody say hello to kit - [PERSON] !	7
If you and [PERSON]'ll gab on about this appointment , I'll see the committees .	2
I don't think you understand the situation . These guys are religious zealots .	4
You better be home tonight , you [GAY SLUR] .	1
I don't want to discourage --	6
It hasn't been all that pleasant for you , has it Mr. [PERSON] ?	6
I did a catalogue with his names and residences .	7
We're not interested in him .	3
Breathe normally , And ease out slowly . Ready ?	4
We all have our own ways of running a ship .	8
[LOCATION] control said you can continue on with your mission .	8
I'll give her your message with my whole army .	1
I don't know what I'm going to do .	6
We must be coming to the station .	2
I thought we'd celebrate . Going to take us to dinner ?	2

You'll get killed just to give something away .	4
Anybody can type .	1
What's happened now ?	2, 7
I think an apology ...	6
Are you looking for somebody ?	7
She's got a witch's brain .	3
So many people are not interested in changing the laws in regards to the internet .	1, 6
Find and fulfill your destiny .	8
You want to give her another shot at him ?	1
I've guarded it with me life .	8
Did I ...	4
He is inspired by the new openness here .	5
How'd it go ?	2

There's a risk of kicking him while he's down .	4
We're going to do everything we can to help you , but you've got to help , too .	8
Yeah , screw them .	1, 3
There's something terrible happening in there .	4

That don't stop me from taking a saintly pleasure when I get a chance .	5
Is that intelligent banking ?	3
I know how that must feel .	6
What do you hope to accomplish ?	1
He'd look very picturesque in the summerhouse .	5
And if you were my friend , you'd do the same thing .	8, 2
Help me ...	8, 4, 6
But it'll look great on you .	2
I'm afraid so .	4
I want to see it .	2
Enough with the water .	1, 3, 6, 7
Then you did it alone !	1
[PERSON] , be careful !	4
This isn't a temple , is it ?	2, 4, 6, 7, 8

Judge , you said we would be entitled to some leeway ...	8, 2
Take my head to the emperor Maybe it will move him	1
I'm not feeling well . This won't take long .	6
From your niece , sir .	5

But at least try my way first .	8
But I just escaped from here ! Don't you understand ?	1
And that's why I don't wan na talk about it if I don't have to .	1
Come on , damn it !	1
How is that going to look at home ?	4
Nitrogen guns , safeties off .	1

It's gone now and I just can't afford to send you your pay cheques any more .	6
We have to go . - Let them wait .	2
Sure , [PERSON] .	8, 5
When a man like Senator [PERSON] gets up and swears that I've been robbing kids of nickels and dimes .	4
This time I'm going right to the top to get you out .	8
Things like this create a bad feeling .	6
Ouch ! That was the antigravity backdrop .	1, 3, 6, 7
That ... that horse we ride those pick six guys bought back ?	1
I hope you have a nice stay in [LOCATION] .	5
Get off my roof !	1

Fifteen hundred ?	7
It's a cruel disease .	4
He's okay .	2, 5
It was utter chaos .	6
Another funeral for the pilot , not as spiffy as [PERSON]'s .	6
It's just that ... the breeding is no longer working .	4
This time it is you who does not understand . I know [PERSON] better than you do .	1
Welcome .	8, 5
Fuck them !	1
Never you mind .	1, 6
I get to live in a place ... it's OK . Don't get me wrong . The air is clean .	6
There's a certain amount of hurry up involved here . My life is in danger . Three ten .	4
No , honey the drink's on me .	8
There'll always be some guy , even some friend of yours , thinking he can treat me like [PERSON] , thinking that it's allowed .	3, 4, 6
What was the movie about ?	2
Let's open the wine now .	2
Get between the treads !	1
Are we in danger ?	4
I'll be in in an hour . - OK .	2

But you haven't had much respect for them .	3
You sober right now ? Uh-huh . Eight months .	5, 7
And I want [PERSON] and [PERSON] ... dead !	1

I don't have much time .	4, 6
Is there no justice in the world ?	1, 3, 6, 7
It makes me sad .	6
You wan na teach me how to handle my own daughter ?	1
And there's nobody to tell me that the results are anything but brilliant , so I live in a comfortable glow of self - appreciation .	5
Mother said you could always tell a lady by her hands .	8
I'm sure it will turn up somewhere .	8
When did you know ?	7
Are we there yet ?	2
Let me at him , five minutes .	1
God !	7
Can -- I was gonna ask you if I could give it to you ?	6
Came out and took off . I stayed with him .	8, 5
The problem is , they already have a settlement .	4
The question is what are you doing here ?	1
You mean you weren't sure if I was ever coming in again .	1
You can count on that .	8
Or merely a lack of imagination ?	2, 6, 7
[LOCATION] has done the impossible .	7
Fucking cannibal .	3
He's lying , mom .	1, 3
But why do you bring this up now ?	7
Such spirit ! Catch me if you can !	1
But no more odd , surely , than my driving away that day , away from her , knowing that , inevitably , we would meet again .	8
I am broke , desperate and very pissed .	1
[PERSON] steers good .	8
What exactly are we looking for , [PERSON] ?	2
You're just saying that .	6
But in that case , We are no more guilty than the rest of the world .	6
They're gonna keep him in that foster home !	6
We're gonna end you ...  And all this ... 	1
Get up ! They won't fuck with us in the water ! Come on !	3
You'll learn quick enough .	8
Another keen son of a bitch .	3
Here on holiday but seems to be having a bit of car trouble ?	5, 6, 7
Speaking of which , what can I get you ?	2
I wonder if the [PERSON] would take the trouble to come to my beautiful room ?	2
Find out where they take the cash .	1
That'll be nice .	5
You're really the tolerant type , [PERSON] !	7
Maybe I'll run into you .	2
We think you're quite brave . And manly .	8, 5
So what's your problem ?	1
I've come to get you - it's my party .	2, 5
He went into [PERSON]'s chamber .	7
Where's your uniform ?	7
How am I gonna get to first base with this girl ?	2
That's our favourite song .	5
Excuse me , I'm looking for a man .	1
The latter , I will be again , because I have managed to reduce a national election down to one state .	2
I tried to make her care , but I couldn't .	6
Violence prone , obsessive / compulsive personality , a history of excessive physical force throughout his years as a [LOCATION] police officer .	3

I wan na marry you .	8, 2, 5
Boy , that old character mut be a kook .	4
But do sit down and have some coffee .	2
Please , give me one more minute !	4, 6
You're real dumb , huh ?	1
Do all directors come to ask young women to sit with their producers ? Um , not all .	7
We got a thousand man - hours on this . Nobody's walking away .	1, 2
I'm hungry .	6
Silly , it never occurred to me .	7
Okay , then let's get going .	2
Never mind .	1, 3
Uh , six reported injured , two are in sick bay , two more seriously being rushed to [LOCATION] .	4
You're a liar , boy .	3
The most beautiful poetry can be about simple things like a cat , or a flower , or rain .	5
I'm not scared really .	8
Oh , yes !	2, 5, 7
I guess everybody had given up hope , including the doctors .	6
Is this the time , or I am blind ?	7
I'll swear that into my own grave .	3
Yeah , and I wish I could keep it !	7
Want to see a strange object ?	2
A perfect place to lose anybody , but this little doll's our cover story .	1
Have you got any interest in coming home to [LOCATION] ?	2, 5
I can't fight you both .	4
Whenever you want to visit their plants , they are open to you .	8
We all thought you were dead .	7
[PERSON]'s been on the edge so often .	4, 6
It's ... Not that big a deal .	8, 6
They bite your neck and drink your blood .	3
Perhaps that's why I'm incapable of having a child .	4
This ain't no poor farm .	1
So what's gonna happen to me ?	4
This is from all of us .	5
Well , it's our way of trying to understand .	8
This anger's not about me . Who are you angry with ?	8
My pleasure , sir .	5
Emily , why are you still using your mother's phone ?	1
They don't tell you why .	4
Can you explain your testimony that there is more stringent posting rules for selling a motorcycle than selling a - year - old ?	1
I ain't making no money watching you boys sleep .	1
Shut up , [PERSON] .	1
It's because of you people that I can not get outside !	3
Why should that worry you ?	7
No ! No !	1, 4, 7
Would you stop harrassing her ? But if you'll let me point out that my client's mental state ...	1, 3
I will get [PERSON] out of the way .	8, 4
We'll have to hope that that's enough .	4
For a boy , it was a kind of paradise .	5
Now , if you'll pardon me , I'm busy .	1
He's all tired out , though , the poor little guy .	6
I'm so relieved .	5
[PERSON] , you're so ... weird !	7
[LOCATION] to [LOCATION] , hauling shit for assholes .	3
Sergeant , does this mean we're through for the day ?	2
You conning him out of the deed without putting down a cent .	3
They're real , aren't they ?	7
Bless you . Father , how can I possibly thank you ?	8
Mom , [PERSON] died .	6
It's all so horrible , isn't it ?	6
Well , haven't you seen the paper ?	7
The sea is nice , take my advice	5
The chaplain will pray .	2
You stupid cow !	1, 3
No , you're not kidding . Um ...	2
What's keeping you ?	1
Damn [PERSON] , this is your last wish ?	7
You mean somebody she let in opened the windows so it looked like a break - in ?	7
You shut up !	1
I guess .	4
I guess you're looking for a place right away , aren't you ?	2
I'm not afraid of your threats .	1
No , I don't want no drink .	1
Boy , I feel great .	5
Hey , what kind of news are you leaving me there ?	2
So , where are we all off to ?	2
I'm alarmed about you .	4
If you want to catch that boat you better stop talking .	1
Nero will wait , sweetie .	8
Why don't you do your sorry ass a favor ?	3
You know , I think I'll go back East and work for a while .	2
I'm not interested in some monkey riding the horse .	3
Before the bomb went off yesterday , do you recall seeing this man ?	2, 6
You'll stump to [LOCATION] with the rest of us .	1
I told you . I never met the hag .	1, 3
Oh , boy .	4
So much for old business .	6
I want you fellows to meet my noble steed [PERSON] .	8
Would you spend the rest of your life with me ?	8, 5
The Ambassador too would be delighted .	5
No , stop it .	1
What didn't work ?	2
I object to you coming here .	1
How long will they be ?	2
Nail it up !	2
This kid has taken a savage beating .	4
Let's get the skiff out and shove off !	5
They made you one of them , you can do the same for me .	2
I don't think we can hold out that long before they find her .	4
The one we've been waiting for .	2
And did you believe this nonsense ?	7
I've got some sandwiches in my pack .	5
A pleasure .	5
[PERSON] , you're so sweet .	5
Don't you like children ?	7
Come on , what are you fellows gaping at ?	1
I come to offer a treaty of peace to King [PERSON] .	8
What am I gonna do when she has a baby ?	4
It just makes me feel real glad to see the Chiefs back on the warpath again ... to coin a phrase .	5
Would you like me to go with you ?	8
This studying on revenge is turning your back on the future ... and letting the past eat at your heart .	3, 4, 6
If you did your cheekbones better , you could look like [PERSON] .	5
Let's get her !	2, 4
What's biting you , [PERSON] ?	1
Bring him to me !	1, 4
What the hell does this all mean ?	1, 2, 7
All's I'm excited about , [PERSON] ... if that horse is gonna run , I'm gonna be on him .	2
We only have minutes on safe window of operation .	2
What's killing the children ?	1, 4, 6
Exactly how inexpensive ?	7
Daddy , I want Mommy !	6
Now you're talking .	5
Very nice , very nice .	5
We don't know much about anything , do we ?	7
You know , it's dangerous for you to be here in the frozen food section .	4
You haven't had the big payday yet .	2, 5
He's quite right . There's nothing wrong with eating dog .	8, 5, 7
A little rush ?	1
You think you have free license to be insulting ?	3
No , you're not listening to me !	1, 6
This time , in sight of my goal , it seemed as if I must meet defeat .	6
To kill the brutals who multiply and are legion .	3
What's all the celebrating ?	7
The dishes are on the table , the refrigerator door was open ...	3
Nutritionally speaking , it is exquisite .	5
I'm so glad to see you .	5
Tell me what [PERSON] was doing with a bribery file .	7
[PERSON] , ain't you gonna do nothing ?	7
Isn't that the truth ?	7
I still have the witness to look after	2
Give me some information . Something . Anything !	1, 3
I don't know about that .	4
I'm not fit to be a senator !	4
Where did you get it ?	2
He's terrific . He's on it .	8
Mr. [PERSON] is a wonderful teacher .	5
He told me they're getting cold feet .	1, 3, 6
We are in great danger .	4
We walk from here .	2
You sound like a rug salesman .	8, 3, 5
Anyway , when do you special intelligence officers do what you're supposed to do ?	1
Now [PERSON] and that dear little bride of his will be able to stay on at [LOCATION] and live happily ever after .	5
Gentlemen , gentlemen . You don't understand .	8, 5, 6
And you wan na know what else I think ?	1
You're kidding me .	1, 3, 7
I told you to not let them out of your sight !	1
You ought to know your way around here pretty well .	8
Now , just a minute , gentlemen .	4
What's more to the point , that money was next year's budget for the Drug Rehabilitation Clinic .	1, 6
We're here to scout , not engage .	3
Birth of some issues right there .	6, 7
I'm sorry , I have a bill ...	6
Can you ever imagine [PERSON] being in a spot like that ?	7
Yo , remember where you are , my friend , before you start acting like a fool .	8
I won't vote on it until I get my questions answered .	1
We can get cheap tickets from [PERSON]'s parents .	2
Oh , I'm sure it was just a nightmare .	8
And now , a happy surprise for all of us .	7
Some things you just don't tell anybody .	1, 3, 4, 6
Well , I didn't have the money .	6
It is to you and you that my name means nothing .	3, 6, 7
We're here to kick some major league butt .	2
So what ?	1, 7
He brought in his own detective to replace [PERSON] .	1, 4
call me tonight or I ' II go crazy .	2
My father died of a heart attack .	6
You're the prettiest woman in the room , sweetheart .	5
Tell [PERSON] to wait in the shop for me .	8
Whether or not you're handicapped .	1
I hate when you do that .	1
You should have thought of that before you left the house .	1
I'll fire you . I'll leave you on the goddamn tarmac .	1, 3
I take it you agree that it is possible for a publisher to also be a participant in a sex trafficking venture , where the pimp himself runs a website .	2
I don't think this bullshit's funny .	3
He wasn't much good , though .	6
Ever since the first day I laid eyes on you , I knew I had to be yours and yours alone .	5
Mr [PERSON] , I was wondering when you'd let me have your blue car .	2
CinCPac wants it all to arrive on time and intact .	8, 2
See , Congress is no different than the rest of the country .	1, 3
The lady comes in sudden and she's got this gun .	4
Can I just have a second before we start ?	8
If you're starving don't waste your money	2
You see the moon out there ?	2
I know something about the law ... and there's gonna be a law against you !	1
Am I gonna see you in there ?	2
On !	2
I've had a hell of a time after I've told this story , but I continue to tell the story because I think it's important for people to understand that this sort of shit goes on in the government !	1, 2, 4
What do I do now ?	2
Of course you know I'm in no danger .	8, 1
Friends , [PERSON] , The president of this network ,	8, 2

No , now not !	1
Still no word from [PERSON] ?	2, 4
Die ... damn it !	1
You guys are so sweet , you know that ?	5
Well , it's a shitty world .	3
I still insist he's paranoid .	3
I hate that cheap little bastard .	3
We've made our decision .	2
She stood for justice .	8, 5
I mean , if our system wasn't any good , why did they take us over in the first place , right ?	7
You don't even have a yellow thing and your green thing is brown .	3
There's just this one hammer .	1
You and [PERSON] have been asked to accept a dangerous mission to [LOCATION] .	4, 6, 7
On the weekends we go out and have a ball .	5
Beautiful .	8, 5
You picked up that awful thing to show us your contempt .	3
That's a sign you must be pretty happy .	5
They want to fight and die as martyrs .	3, 6
God - damn it !	1
Don't cry , honey .	6
I hope you'll enjoy this .	2
We don't -- we don't wan na do this but ...	4, 6
So , what do you think ?	2
Junior , I got some buttons for the kids and some stickers for their bikes .	5
Darling , why weren't you disappointed ?	7
At least you'll find English hospitality better than they found Spanish .	5
Thanks for lending it to me .	8
I beg your pardon ?	7
They're not putting up the money .	1
Easterner speaks with forked tongue .	3
Has Mr. [PERSON] ever expressed to you ... Any reservations about [PERSON]'s abilities ?	2, 4
If central government should ever fail , power can be transferred instead to a system of local officials dispersed across the country .	8
This is only going to make it worse for you .	1
Weather conditions have improved tremendously over the mainland , so you won't have any trouble seeing the target .	5
But he didn't give a shit .	1
I want the men to be happy .	8
You have your orders . Aye , sir .	8
Some fight .	8
What a man !	7

The captain left a sinking ship .	4
Where the hell are they ?	1
You want to work for somebody else ? - No .	8
Why would a dumb Polack like you think he could outsmart someone like me ?	1
It's no bluff .	8
Every time it rains , it gets all yucky .	3
I'll be yours if you don't kick in with that $ 10 .	8
I'd like you to meet somebody .	8
Yeah , she seemed to have a pretty good time .	5
Perhaps you could enlighten the jury as to what else the government's giving you in exchange for this testimony .	8, 4
Hurry , hurry !	4
You should !	2
Well , don't you understand that if your crops fail this year , next year you're going to have to have another blood sacrifice ?	4
I find it really insulting that you assume it has to be a guy .	3
It is not a pivotal project in your career .	6
Don't walk away from me .	1
I think you might be my best brother , too .	8
Seems he has a taste for beef .	7
Your refusal to speak to me is tediously immature , [PERSON] .	3
And lock your doors while you're driving , Because there is no telling what kind of hustlers Can come up to your car .	4
Almighty Sir ... do not drop us in the claws of the eternal death ...	4
I'm awake , [PERSON] .	5
Certainly you would give any information you had on a case ... To your investigating staff ? Certainly .	8
Oh ...	6
I have information for you .	2
You wouldn't have come if you thought I was here .	6
It is being covered up , but , probably not for the reasons you might think .	2, 4
Just what we don't need around here , some scrawny , milk - drinking ...	3
All right . Let's go through it again .	2
We're all gonna die .	4, 6
Hmm . - We're not underwater . Yeah .	7

Would you like to hear something ?	2
I'm a frightened tramp .	4
If ever a funeral laid an egg , that one did .	3

Can I help , or would you like to leave a message ?	2
Your idea of a chance at him was uncorroborated statements from an informant who was doing hard time and who would sell his own mother to get his sentence reduced .	1
Think God punishes the King to have a French whore .	1, 3
I'm waiting for reports from some of you .	8

The blood of [LOCATION] knows all truth .	2, 5
Well , maybe she could dance one more time , just for tonight , huh ?	2, 5

You know , much as I hate to give [PERSON] J.[PERSON] too much credit , he might have gotten a hold of something when he said that was pretty private stuff going on out there .	8
You put my eye out , you bitches !	1
Don't we need supplies ?	7
If I'm not on guard every moment , you steal across the border into reality .	4

It's good publicity .	5
So the millionaire speculator is turning respectable .	3
He was nice .	5
[PERSON] , I don't want to hear it .	6
That's cool .	5
And now your grandmother is here and the ceremony starts at noon .	2, 4, 6

I will pray for you .	8
I'm pleased to be wrong .	5
Go get them , kid .	8, 2, 5
I was astonished at the extent of his reputation .	2, 4, 5, 7
They know that if that power was , you know , delineated to the average person , we wouldn't need them anymore .	4
Well , I'll tell you one thing .	8, 2
Aw , jeez ! Look at these guys .	5
Don't tell me to take it easy !	1

This doesn't make sense .	7
He laid me out , strung me up and then ...	3
Well , my mother was a music teacher and married my father , whose family was extremely wealthy .	8, 5
Eat your breakfast and forget it .	1
They have the opposing counsel's secretary poking around in their goddamn file room .	1
Mr. [PERSON] was the first man ever to treat me decent .	8
They ain't bad for waffles .	5
That might not be the worst of it .	4
Would there still be a court file on this case ?	2
I've been looking for you all over , hoping you were dead .	3
Go home .	1, 3
I'm obliged for your hospitality .	8
She told me that you've been going through some things ... in your personal life .	6
A bomb ?	4
Take me to them , please .	2
Six months or so ago , I fell in love with one of them .	5
So help me God .	4
Why don't you just get out of here .	1
Get off me !	1, 4
It's so remote I thought I would ... be safe there . I figured no one could find me .	6
Oh , well I'm no psychiatrist ... . She looks to me like she needs professional help .	4, 6
Just because it is big and white and a yacht , is it not still dirt ?	1, 3, 7
Somebody help me .	4
What do you mean , call ?	7
Don't you know me ?	4, 7
Everything is part of the great lie .	6
My argument with [PERSON] had nothing to do with any sudden realization .	1
Think I should go out with [PERSON] ?	8, 2, 7
I see my child ... in different poses ... that look like she was drugged .	4
What's it to you ?	1
I was getting a message for you .	8
I'm going to have to leave this place real soon , thanks to you .	1
I'll do one for you . How about that ?	8, 2
I'm sure that's thanks to you as well .	5
What I'm going to do is save Mr. [PERSON] from being embarrassed in open court .	2
Hold the fishbowl .	3
All right , fine . Let's do it .	8
Nearly creamed us both .	4, 7
It gives you a good feeling when you can help somebody .	5
Didn't you hear me ? I said go away !	1
Miss [PERSON] , could I have a word with you in private ?	8
I'm really not sure .	6, 7
Halt !	1, 2
Even so , quite wrong to threaten . Not the way to treat an enlisted man .	1, 6
You changed that , and you can't change it back .	6
Before you know it , we'll be good again .	5
So , are you going to tell the police ?	1, 2, 4
But when men who aren't actually there have intercourse with you , it is time to see a good psychiatrist .	4
I've saved you guys from big junk collars , traced lost stuff , fingered stools .	1, 7
You haven't wasted your time , [PERSON] .	5
Doc , can I go with you to the AA meeting ?	8
Get off my back . I want to go home .	4, 6

I think I'll be just fine .	5
Continue , [PERSON] .	8

Stop it !	1
God , what's our status ?	4
You're betrothed ?	7
Put them back .	1
Quick ! Quick !	1, 2, 7
But it's our necks you're risking now , and I say no .	4

Time drags when you're tired .	6

The Kid will have to play him .	2, 4
Now , this will get him !	1
See this or that doctor .   Here's how to solve your problems .  	3
And I'll make you so much money you can swim in it .	2
The man who blows his own horn .	3

God save the Queen !	8, 5
Look at your eyes !	7
You look very beautiful .	5

Shit ...	4
She always ruins everything .	1, 6
Oh , thank you . Yes !	5
Find someone to type this .	8

You've had it too easy and you don't know it . No , no . I do know it .	1
[PERSON]'s going in there and lend a little comfort to the prisoners .	2
I asked you a question .	1
Let's go home .	2
Fuck it , man .	1, 6
If you want him to die , shoot now .	1, 4
The trouble is , I need money for manufacturing and promotion .	4
We can take blood from anything if it's coming to us .	2
You're giving premature value judgments .	1
It's getting real bright out here .	7
Is this [PERSON] , who we went to [LOCATION] with ?	7
And what does he want ?	1
She was so excited to see her mother .	5
It hurts , hurts , hurts .	6
It's like working in a filling station , watching the cars go by .	3, 6
Please , one at a time .	1
I don't wan na see you split up .	6
Want me to help ?	8
You hurt his feelings .	6
A heroic thought , Barley .	7
Ain't nobody in the world gonna drive this except me .	1
I must admit , you put some very convincing arguments on this table .	8
All I can charge him with is riding on a train . They're gonna walk .	1
Maybe it's me and [PERSON] .	7
Let's have coffee together .	2
That's bold .	8
You do , you look amazing , isabel .	5
You question the judge's integrity ?	1, 7

Sure as hell is . He called us from there five minutes ago .	1, 4
Why should I turn this bank over to anybody else ?	1
Ghosts !	4
Hey , please , just hear me .	2, 6
You don't think I can smell it ?	1
Kindliness and sincerity , and if you'll forgive me , modesty , mean more to a husband than all the wit and beauty in the world .	5
What are you talking about ? She doesn't have a twin sister .	1, 7
Father . I'm seeing a pattern here .	2, 4
Don't shoot !	4
Time was I'd squeeze a pimple like you .	3

I'm going down to [LOCATION] , then [LOCATION] for a few days .	2
That we can agree on . I look forward to hearing about your platform .	2
Don't worry .	8, 2, 5
So it really is the same old [PERSON] that we all knew and loved .	7
I'm just not certain it's the right thing .	4
You only get one pass at it .	7
You fall for a fruit man , you run off and marry him . Boy June , you really know how to pick them .	2, 5
Don't sit down .	1
Thank goodness you're all right .	5, 7

The idea that Backpage is just trying to cater to fetishes of old men , doesn't really involve underage children ,	3
Are you the Buljanoff who fought on the barricades ?	7
Why don't you go back and play hero in your own world , Earthling ?	3
Ka - rumph ! We were smashed to port .	1, 7
At this rate , we'll have to head home inside hours .	2, 3
The assassination is the latest act of terrorism by [PERSON] following the bombing of a drug treatment clinic that left five dead .	1, 3, 4, 6
She was a terrific girl , [PERSON] .	2, 5
You're a liar .	1, 3
They meant nothing .	6
But this child is the world's hope .	8
If it were up to the chief , he'd charge you with Detective [PERSON]'s death and suspend you .	8, 1
We're at an impasse .	1
Do you remember last year , when we had fun , when we had a good time ?	5
Sit back .	1
Children , I have bad news for you .	6

But , of course , she's lying .	3
We solve every murder in less than two hours .	8
You didn't come to my wedding .	6
Mine left me too .	6
Apparently there's been a bomb and some shooting in the street .	4
Spent time making that , you know .	5
I can tell when someone lies to me .	1, 3
That's why it's a good idea to get boys out of the crowded cities for a couple of months of the year .	5
He's not here , darling .	6, 7
Do you remember when we first met ?	8, 2, 4, 5
Something wrong ?	2
Your friend's a crook , a liar and a thief .	1, 3
You do look pale .	6
What do you mean by that ?	7
Any chance you could tidy up my trailer while I'm gone ?	2
Just give me some coffee , will you , babe ?	2
What do we do in case of an accident ?	4
You deserve it .	8
So I phoned Mr [PERSON] and he agreed to pick it up .	8
Why , if it isn't our friend the sharpshooter .	7
Senorita ? Your bare feet are showing .	3, 6
With my hand out , not in million years .	3

I took the liberty of ordering everything . I didn't know what you'd like .	2
I'm not blind .	1
How do I know you'll jump ?	4
Then , you'll want to say goodbye .	6
[PERSON] , I can not go to prison .	4
Yes , smaller than the smallest , I meant something too .	5
You're not gonna see the sunset over there .	1, 3
We'll sit in the back and sneak away as soon as it's over .	2
Oh , my gosh , you must be [PERSON] !	5, 7
What are you doing , making a career out of this ?	7
As bad as it was having her missing , it was so traumatizing to hear these words coming from your - year - old child .	4, 6
He spares us the mercifully quick extinction of the hangman's rope ... and gives the slow death of slavery .	6
It was mainly the beer I had with dinner mixed with the pain medicine I still take for when you shot me in the ass .	1
And what makes you think that note would interest me ?	1

[PERSON] accuses [PERSON] of introducing a boys camp bill for his own profit !	1

What do you care ?	1
You mustn't speak to Little Big Man like that .	1
We have to leave ! Either on a plane to [LOCATION] , or feet first !	2, 4
I didn't know we were on a first - name basis , but how are you ?	7
That to marry [PERSON] would be the most senselessly cruel and destructive thing you will ever have done ?	1, 4, 7

Because of your colonel's stubbornness we are far behind schedule .	1
Would they mock him ?	4, 6, 7
Don't bother to get up I'll take care of myself	1
Silence this fool , [PERSON] .	3
I am glad that Senator [PERSON] is calm , because every once in a while I'm ready to do a [PERSON] on these guys .	1
It took me seven years , but I got him !	5
I'll brain that guy .	1
Help him , [PERSON] . [PERSON] , you got rear ! - I got one mag left .	2, 4
Come on , [PERSON] .	1, 2
We're way out of our league !	3
Turn me loose and get out .	1
He kisses my hand .	5
If we could get the poor kids off the streets for a few months every summer and let them learn something about nature and American ideals .	2
[PERSON] ...	6
Stripped of all that it's no wonder they become suicidal .	1, 3, 6
I'll get you now !	4
Fine , fine . Say , [PERSON] , something kind of important has come up ...	6
Contact Ambassador [PERSON] and buy me more minutes .	2, 7
I'm all packed .	5
Everything'll be all right .	8
One day , you're going to make a slip . All this wealth you've got won't check against my list .	2
Where'd you learn to talk dirty like that ?	2
Give me that !	1
We don't tolerate nudity in any shape or form .	1, 3
Mine was big as a grapefruit .	5
What precinct , sir ?	7
Don't worry about the others , they're just senators .	8
Although I'm a duckling today , tomorrow I'm a swan	2
I know it's a terrible time .	6
Supposing I don't tell you ?	1
No , you done me a nice little favour doing that there .	5
What happened to him ?	7
His words are too profound	5, 7
I could do with a lot of that .	2
Tell Clyde I'll see him tomorrow .	2
I put the kettle on .	2
Wan na hear what I wrote about you ?	2
He's such a little man .	1
That's him !	1, 2
Somebody moved it .	1
Sorry about that .	6
It can be absolutely breathtaking .	5
Don't you get it ?	1
I hope every member of this body feels as I do .	4
Are you joking ?	7
You are fake news .	1
Is that right ?	7
At any rate , gentlemen , a charming , exquisite woman .	5
I'll be right back .	2
Younger Bear was just trying to hand me the worst possible insult .	3
I will start with you .	2
Excuse me ?	7
Oh , good gracious .	4
Oh , God ...	6, 7
[PERSON] , are you familiar with Article of Navy regulations ?	4
I'll do that . Uh ... I'll go find him and I'll just ask him where car really is .	2, 4
First we'll get you legal and tuck you in bed with [PERSON] .	2
Nobody comes , nobody pays any attention .	6
How about Admiral [PERSON] , sir ?	2
I'm moving abroad .	2
Myself . When I am in possession of my faculties and [PERSON] is not .	1, 4
You will be cooperative ?	8
We're on holiday .	5
If I spoke , you barely answered .	6
This is dreadful !	6
He did that night .	3, 4
Ha , a bit bourgeois , don't you think ?	5
You little piece of shit .	3
Let me in ! Let me in !	7
That is hardly for you to decide .	1
He should be here with his family .	6
They see violence , they'll become violent .	4
I'm not going to make fun of you .	8
What's going on between you two ?	7
It was damn stupid of me , wasn't it ?	6
She'd come to [LOCATION] to look for her child . I helped her as far as I could .	5
You chickenshit bastard .	3
You know what , I will call you back . Okay ? I love you .	8, 5
Next time , make it good .	2
You never know what is looking ... or what you think .	7
I'll have some clothes brought by tomorrow and your tape cassette thing for your music and a quilt .	8
Why don't you  try it ? 	1
There's no question . I'm not going with you .	1
And now they've lost it .	1, 5, 6
I can not !	2, 7
And he was so sorry for locking me up .	6
Don't look so depressed .	6
Two , sir .	8
A sequined gown dragging me down .	6
Well see you !	2
Why did you lie to me ?	3
Now , that's original .	7
No , Your Majesty !	1, 4
That's the first encouraging thing you've said .	7
Do you know , for a second you had me worried ?	4
We'll have a crew yet !	2
And you and I are going out together .	2
We expected you to come in here with a plan .	1
So far so good , senor .	5
Could you give me the number of the sorority house ?	8
Up ! Shut up !	1
Oh , he's only kidding .	8
You're going bald too .	6
Whoever killed him's gonna pay .	1
You know what you ought to do , love ?	8
Well , how else was I supposed to get [PERSON] to come home ?	1
Really . - Am I no longer allowed to give gifts ?	1, 6, 7
You rat !	1
But we've got to take a closer look at this big boy .	7
This is a house of ill fame , and I'm a fallen flower .	6
This would make a terrific playroom .	2
[PERSON] , will you let me finish ?	1
His body and clothes soaked in blood ?	4
I'm so scared my bones are clicking , like dice on a [PERSON] crap table .	4
We're trying to get to a place called [LOCATION] , a couple of hundred miles north , I think .	2
Here , faster , before the planes are back .	4
No man , woman or beast will ever desire you again .	3
Haven't you heard ?	2
It was really hard .	4, 7
Oh ! I go there quite often .	8, 7
And we learned a lot from you .	8
Thirsty , [LOCATION] ?	8, 2
More !	1
Fight !	1, 2, 5
They're going to nail us , no matter what we do .	4
Come on out here with me and I'll show you .	2
What was that shooting just now , [PERSON] ?	2, 4, 7
Come and meet the others .	2
Art here saw her fighting him off .	1
Congratulations .	8, 5
Well , like I said , right now , I've got a bigger problem .	6
Thanks , man .	8
Since we are nearing the island of [PERSON] , You will have an opportunity of selecting your own food .	2
The fleet didn't order us to manoeuvre at discretion .	1, 3
Didn't you march today ?	7
[PERSON] looked cute .	5
So you really think they're keeping the missiles on a ship ?	2, 7
We have an idea that might help .	8
If you'd walked when I said , I wouldn't have been there .	1
This blood is mine ! Do you understand ? The blood is mine !	1, 4
I'm going to destroy all of you evil monks	1
When I finish , then I'll escape and get it printed	2
She's always in the bathroom !	1
What do think I contacted you for ?	7
[GAY SLUR] .	1, 3
I'm not required to do your public relations .	1
We're payin' 'em back , boy .	1, 2
You aren't one of them , are you ?	1, 4
I can tell you now I was a little worried when I heard you weren't going to be here yourself .	4
Yeah .	8, 2, 5
You ain't very friendly , are you ?	1
Well , that's the problem . Um ... The bad guys took it .	6
He said no pilots .	6, 7
So leave us alone and anybody who wants it gets it .	1
He would present his incontestable alibi and it would be in safety forever .	3
I'm ready to testify . He'll go to jail .	8
You are my only hope .	8
Oh , great , [PERSON] .	8, 5
Isabel , you look very lovely tonight .	7
Take good care of him .	8
Fatter ? - No , Dad .	7
And life begins again .	8, 2, 5
What in the world is all this ?	7
She's a mighty cold woman ... prancing about [LOCATION] by herself .	3
I didn't recognize you standing up .	7
A little poontang might ease your mind a bit .	5, 6
To be agreed upon price .	8
You're not telling me anything I don't know .	1
Now that you have our city , what do you want with it ?	2
He's in trouble . Boy ?	6
Cowards !	3
I'm leaving you , my dear .	6
If you do that you'll get nothing , except maybe the police after you .	4
Yeah . They're bleeding .	4
Oh , we can do lots of things by then .	2
That's not for you to say .	1
I'm the one who can -	8
In , I formed the center for the study of extraterrestrial intelligence , to form a diplomatic core to make peaceful contact with these civilizations .	8, 2
All the candy you need . A nice baby - sitter .	5
C'mon [PERSON] , we got ta find her before the old lech does .	1
I just got this crew broke in , so don't go screwing 'em up with your old - fashioned ways .	3
The point is of no return ... and you've reached it !	1
You've nothin to bitch about !	3
In a few months , I will become a citizen .	2
Would you like us to take a break ?	3
The trouble with me ? I'm not very good at looking ahead .	6
If I call you up in the middle of the night , tell you to come over and screw my old lady while I watch , what are you gonna do ?	1, 3
We're realists , knowing that we're on the outside looking in . - We calmly accept our uncertain position . - Yeah .	8, 5
And how about some pepper and salt and vinegar , eh ?	2
Profess --	7
These heels are grotesque .	3
Clearly , we didn't trust each other with them .	6
How do you feel ?	8, 2, 5
Groovy .	5
I've known those kids since they were in preschool .	8
We'll have him watched from now until the day he sails .	1
And tell her her old granddad will be back soon .	2
I think it sucks . - What sucks .	1
That was a nice tribute to the guys .	5
All that bread and livin' in a dump like this . Smashed cars , busted - out buses ... but all good stashes .	6
I was afraid of making a fool of myself .	4
Well , I still want him for that train robbery up at [LOCATION] .	3
[PERSON] is coming tomorrow night .	2
You didn't think I was dead , too , did you ? [PERSON] .	1, 7
Just hold it steady until I tell you .	8
That's a good idea .	8, 5
There's no hard feelings between us .	5
What if I can't take it off ?	4
Well , you know what I think ? I think you wouldn't be here if she did nothing wrong .	1, 6
She's good at her job .	8
The Lady herself Inglethorp !	7
Come on . I want to dance .	5
Nice to see you too .	5
He's got something bottled up behind that dashing charm .	7
I should have fired him when we fired [PERSON] .	1, 3, 6
You carry the stench of death like the plague .	3
I'm tired of this baby crap !	3
Wouldn't you enjoy that ?	5
You got the proof .	8
Hi , nice to meet you .	2
You're a godsend .	8, 4, 5
Look at that shit .	3
So , do you think you could get me a TV ?	2
Do you know what they say about girls who play ?	3
I heard you got married .	5
You want me to check that oil ?	8
[PERSON] is stupid .	3
So I'm gonna be sayin' good night .	6
Saint Deus . What she said ?	7
There's a lovely fire in the living room .	5
I wish we did this before .	5
It's me and you .	8
You know , this ship is going much too fast .	4
l had a dream that I was drowning .	2, 4, 6
I barely know her . I found her like this and I brought her here .	6
We'll take care of her later , eh ?	2
His plane could be late !	4
Wish for our lives !	4
Then , when you've recovered your strength , we'll discuss the plan .	8
Japs !	4
Get back on the job .	1
I was going nearly crazy 'cause I couldn't find Little Sheba .	4
All right . I'll talk to [PERSON] .	1
The Navy has three psychiatrists who will testify that [PERSON] is sane .	8
Was she really sick ?	7
We're going for a ride !	2
I kept my mouth shut because I didn't want them to get in trouble .	6
Are they all hollow shells ? !	7
Hang on , hang on .	2
The State offers as evidence ... From the defendant's suitcoat ... A hair identified by the Police Crime Lab as that of the deceased .	2, 5, 7
Where's all the money today ?	7
[PERSON] , what's the most recent communication we've received ?	4
So you're [PERSON] .	7
and very loyal to [PERSON] .	8
That's why you brought me here ?	7
This is all I'm capable of right now .	6
There's no need for sarcasm .	3
[PERSON] , thanks ever so much .	8
Come on , the tougher the competition , the better you used to like it .	2, 5
You know , be very close .	2
I'll talk to him .	8
Yes , but the soup bowl of coffee it was so completely crushed that there was no possibility of analysing his content .	1
He stole them turnips .	3
Get rid of your gum .	6, 7
I didn't mean anything bad .	6
I'm telling you , she won't marry me !	1
Ma'am , I don't know how to put into words the sorrow I feel .	6
You came as an enemy to destroy me .	6
Dorcas , it brings me stamps , please .	1, 3
Where is [PERSON] ? !	7
I care for you very much , Inglés .	8
Who is it ?	2
What's this about a film ?	7
You were very good in Public Domain .	5
The children of my world will have no more stories to read .	6
I want to see it now !	2
Is that why you hate them so much ?	1
Why did you change words in the middle of the sentence ?	7
I knew it all along though , didn't I ? What else it is new , right ?	2, 5, 7
Yeah , she's a nice girl , [PERSON] .	8
Was this clown such a bad guy ?	1, 2
You love her or what ?	7
Well , that was a mistake . I can vouch for her .	8
My father hates him . My wife hates him .	1, 6
I just came to escort you home .	8
Oh , yeah , great !	5
There will be no further mistakes from the officers and crew .	3, 6
Go on , give yourself a treat .	5
She's in labor now ?	7
I bet you've known a lot of lawyers .	2
You're not talking to this guy .	3
We can't let you out of here . You know that . Of course .	4
I met her at the grocery store . - ( babbling ) - isaac .	5
It's a nice sentimental gesture , CinCPac sending your old cruiser .	8, 2, 5
Something's happened to the dog .	7
I must go .	6
Wet it with tears , bleed on it , [PERSON] .	1, 2
During the night , I was woken by [PERSON] crying .	6
Traitor !	3
How can I take time when I know what's going on ?	6
Now , let's have some music .	2
It has a wonderful ring .	5
In which case , you'd be throwing out decades of disarmament progress .	1, 2
Because it seems so hopeless , is that it ?	6
Well , now where are you going ?	1
My son's missing since last night .	4
I wouldn't be stupid enough to bring it home .	1
It's me , you fool .	1, 3, 5
Miss [PERSON] , listen .	1
Doesn't it blow your mind ?	2
Thank goodness .	5
I want it to be clear and known that my daughter , [PERSON] , was raped .	1, 3
Got ta have good nerves , though .	8
Buy it or wreck it !	1
Frank . The Benzedrine's got my teeth wiggling .	3
A lot of the gauges over the engineer's ... panel are broken .	4
[PERSON] was bad news .	1, 3
Who - Who ? Who's sick ?	6, 7
You're a credit risk .	3
I just keep thinking that he needed me and I wasn't there .	6
I told you no liquor in the office .	3
Get out of the way !	1, 3
I want everything he's got .	2
We have to drop the case .	6
[PERSON] killed [PERSON] ?	4, 7
Let's put this on your wrist . What is that ? Ok , this is a digital heart monitor .	4, 7
I can make a recess happen .	2
All you need to know about the Trinity is this . God is like a shamrock !	5
Let's go give that cop a bad time .	1, 2, 3, 5
That's very sporting of you .	5
I'm gonna vomit .	3
Shall we play ball , boys ?	2
Good as money can buy .	5
We're all alone in this .	6
There's no one left to fly the plane .	4
You know , just have more fun with it , that's all .	8
I've called you dozens of times .	1
Cute , isn't she ?	5
I wouldn't want him to think I'm not sympathetic .	6
Great view . I bet you can see all the way to the ocean from out here .	2, 5, 7
But I don't know anything about [LOCATION] .	2, 7
I have worked and struggled to make myself an American .	6
Which I will never understand .	3
We should both go .	4
I'd give every horse I own to get a chance at that fella .	1
I've forgotten how good a bad woman feels .	5
I can't breathe in here .	4
We are delayed . Your mother hates that we are late for the tea .	3, 6
The worst would be a relief .	1, 6
You're in charge , sir .	8
I'm gonna use it .	2
You found it on a bench , a dog's been at it ...	3
Accepted him lord ... Lick me !	2
Take care of yourself .	8
Didn't they ask you about this ?	7
I'm gonna force them into their room , grab their stuff , point the gun in their faces .	1, 2
Anyways , I don't give a damn .	1
I promise you .	8
We wouldn't last more than hours before we had a fatal accident !	4
[PERSON] , listen to him .	8, 3, 4, 6
Lousy freaks !	1, 3
Surprise , surprise .	1, 3
You're like another person .	6
She plans her suicide .	4, 6, 7
Rock , go !	4
Be warned . she usually means exactly what she says .	4
Damn it .	1
Any suggestions ?	2
I'd like you to stay at my house .	8
Well , that broke that up .	1, 4
If you had any chivalry in you , or were nice ...	3
Die , you bastard !	1
You could change decent and decent . Go straight .	2, 5
I'm clearing out of that office everything I own .	1
I don't feel very good .	3, 4, 6
You can always find somebody to set you up , right ?	1
Either you're a fool or an inhuman woman .	3
I hope that you will uphold justice	8, 2
My grandma's really sick ,	4, 6
Want to be a hero , yeah ?	8, 2
And we didn't know how to help her deal with it .	6
You're alive !	5
You got a big mouth . At least you can put it to good use on the witness stand .	1
You can't kill him .	6
You protest too much .	1
Mistakes can always be corrected	5
It's all that ghost's fault	1
Nobody's blaming the SEALs and nobody is blaming you , [PERSON] .	8
What did [PERSON] say to get you so upset ?	6
Beautiful . - Uh-huh . Yeah .	8
I'll take the scenic route by foot .	2
What is with you ? What goes with you ?	1, 3
Goddamn it .	1, 4
Daddy , you found [PERSON] !	7
No further questions .	3
You tell [PERSON] ?	2
Get ready . We need you to drop something off .	2
Smack him in the face !	1
The pretty one on the right . I think she likes you .	5
If that horse would run tomorrow	1
I didn't tell him .	6
The purpose of my journey is to pacify the people	5
I don't know . I must think about it .	2, 7
You guys , I'm so excited !	2, 5
I never imagined what was a work for woman .	7
It breaks my heart .	6
He looked nice .	5
Hope you'll be there .	2
I only saw her when the family rented a farm in the summer .	6
I've never been happier in my life .	5
No , these are mine , I gave you money .	1
I haven't seen you for days .	7
Both those guys on the trailer are in it .	3, 4
Wan na apologize for the other night .	3, 6
I'll be forced to shoot you again .	3
I couldn't sleep .	6
That soda shop was something .	5
Why don't you run on home , or you'll get hurt worse than before , [GAY SLUR] .	1, 3
He'll be a good friend .	2
Hadn't they promised to keep our name out of it ?	7
You meet somebody and you only got one night to really get to know them .	6
[PERSON] , you're going too fast .	1
Meet the man I'm going to marry .	2
They got ta be punished .	3
Well , that depends upon your point of view , professor . What do you mean by that ?	1, 3
I'm going to see if I can talk to that young girl .	2
Well , it ain't much now , [PERSON] , but me and my partner , we got big plans .	2
Oh , and he's handsome too , no doubt .	5
We have a democratic process , where all these sort of sensitive issues will be handled legally , we do not .	1
[LOCATION] will be your next stop !	2
And the more dangerous you are , the shorter the options on your future .	4
One last compliment , okay ?	2
Oh , boy , is this great !	5
She still eating cereal with her fingers ?	3
[PERSON] , this is intolerable !	3
The circuit is overloaded . It's your bloody exercise machine . It's not my stair stepper .	1
It's all my fault .	3, 6
I bear them no malice . I'm sorry for them .	6
How did you manage to get so friendly with [PERSON] ?	7
You're a handsome and powerful man .	8
She also has a drinking problem , and I have no idea where she is .	3
You knew that too ?	7
Second floor secure . - Right .	8
Oh , it's a sad day for all of us .	6
[PERSON] , you look very handsome in a tuxedo .	5
Then there's nothing left for me .	6
Therefore , I'll always get laid more than you , which is fundamentally unjust , am I right ?	8, 5
The hero of 50,000 , boys and 100,000 , parents .	8
Trouble .	4, 6
You take half the troop and follow those that went to the east .	8
I feel As a tear .	6
But if we work hard together and if fortune smiles on us , we'll be able to make you into a human being .	3
My seat belt's too tight .	1
So long , suckers !	3
I can't tell you how glad I am to see you .	5
I regret the things that I done .	3, 6
You suggested I needed a representative on [PERSON] .	7
I don't think we have anything for you .	6, 7
Learn to read , walk , talk , smile , and even fight .	2
Well done indeed .	2, 5
We've known him since we were kids .	8, 5
Tusk doesn't have any friends .	6
Tries to make it look like rape .	3
He's gone to .	5
Still love me ?	4
And I haven't seen her since .	4, 6
He never make a fool of myself , ever .	8, 5
I just wish I could tell him how much I appreciate this .	2
Just like before !	2
I thought we could even get you a new dress	2
You're really sick , you know that ?	3
Today , the captain ordered a general drill for the safety of the crew .	8, 2
I hope he dies of pneumonia . - Did you see that shit ?	1
It's my party and I'll cry if I want to	1
I know that you are tough .	8, 4
Yeah , we're just like clockwork .	5
It was a good party , wasn't it ?	5
As an ensign in the United States Navy . - - You go down to the sea to fight in the toughest conflict of all time .	8
I represent your partner .	8
Something about a place called [PERSON] .  He's dying . 	6
I'm involved with someone else .	6
Help me !	8, 4, 7
Just get it over with .	1, 3
I miss the time when I had you to myself every day .	6
You better start reforming , [PERSON] .	1
You took him to a freaky fortune lady who scared the shit ...	3
I killed a man I hated today .	1
You mean you're trading in your horse for a wagon ride ?	7
You're absolutely wonderful .	5
She can't make it on her own .	4
Yes . I'll meet you in [PERSON] .	2
Oh , yes , I do . I want you to go home and tune in the show !	2
He's the only one that's ever been nice to me .	8
You're invaluable , [PERSON] .	8
You're fucking right .	1, 2
Can we ever believe again ?	6
I wish they'd both go out .	1
Or some professional individual saying ,	8, 2
Even if they got lost somewhere .	4
[PERSON] , you'll come with me ?	2
My heart is packed so full of love for you .	5
I'm thinking , I did it .	8
You're very wise .	8
Don't kid yourself .	1
I'm so glad we stayed !	5
Don't you think I know how you plan to get out ?	1, 3, 7
I've examined him several times and ... I think he's begun to trust me .	8
You won't have any money after the rangers get through with you .	1, 2
No deal !	1
As a matter of fact , you look great .	5
When I was a little girl , like so many others , there was no money to buy shoes for me ,	6
It upsets me that you suspect him , even for a second .	1
It's your responsibility to be here for us !	1
That last part , there's something off about it .	6
We'd love to .	2, 5
They're trying to take his old man's land .	3
But then , I wouldn't have had a chance to thank you .	2
I got my rights !	1
If you don't tell me all you know , you become an accessory before the fact of murder .	3
The bitch !	1
But don't worry , I'll show you how .	8
What'll it be ?	2
We're human beings , you know .	3
You got ta get these emotions under control , son .	1, 3
[PERSON] , I never did thank you for hauling me out of that river .	8
A quick drive and we'll call back .	2
I saw the little girl was hurt .	6
What is that ?	2
If you continue to annoy me about this girl ... who is no responsibility of mine , I'll have you arrested .	1
If that's all what we all thinking , why isn't someone just come right out and say it ?	7
We were scared to hell .	4
Absolutely hilarious .	5
Thank you , Mr. [PERSON] .	5
Thank you very much .	8
Dad , will you teach me how to fight ?	8, 1, 2, 5
We're gonna get married .	2
Mom ?	4
And given your background , I'm sure you can figure it out .	8, 3
You certainly are !	1
Some loser gets a crush on you , you could throw him in the river , tie him to a piano and he'd come back faster than a dog with a bone .	1, 3
All right ? So I'll play you even .	2
When I think of that kid , I want to cry .	6
And then came the war .	6
You're not that person anymore .	6
Don't resist us .	1, 2
What about the Berserkers ?	2, 4
Yeah , but what do you think about the rest of it ?	2
I am ready , Mr. [PERSON] .	2
Oh , I just don't think I'm gonna have the time for it .	6
He's afraid I'll tell the truth about my relationship with [PERSON] ...	4
And nowhere is more dangerous than their local bar , the rat catcher .	4
It's hard to be strict with a man who loses money so pleasantly .	3
I have rights .	1
I didn't call because I thought you might be asleep .	8
Five years ago . Bingo .	7
I miss you too .	6
You win this race , and you'll get three years ' pay .	8
I'll ask the questions , you just nod or shake your head .	1
I have an idea !	5
We'll all squeeze in .	8
I've been called a lot of things , but  comfortable  !	7
Pain - in - the - balls [PERSON] needs to go see the chest doctor .	2
Cam ?	7
Your vendetta has dragged on long enough .	6, 7
You're kidding , right ?	7
This strange coffee is a bore , but what can I do when I can't sleep ?	6
I love those guys .	5
Oh , no . Come on . You don't know that .	8
After all , I had caused the girl considerable discomfort .	6
Don't I know you ?	7
Are you comfortable ?	2, 5
You ain't got no place to go , [PERSON] .	6
I got that Hawaiian Sea Frontier dispatch decoded .	5
He's complete now .	8, 5
Be nice to that girl .	1
We've come to wish you joy .	5
You should have learned by now !	1
I would like to protest the counsel's twisting of words .	1, 3
Look , don't blame us because the warship shelled you .	1
Come on , come on , don't drop it ...	8, 4
Act natural .	4
I'm merely reflecting on your extraordinary good fortune .	1
You don't care about me .	6
Excuse us for interrupting . We're from the Rescue Aid Society .	8
You'll go together and keep working as a team .	8
Well , what are we waiting for ?	2
Now get . It's all right , [PERSON] .	1
Good to see you're still kicking .	5
Give it to me !	1
All the best fools come from [LOCATION] but only a greater fool would go there . 	3
You don't seem very excited about it .	6
Oh , my poor husband .	6
It will be , will be .	8
You won't stand for it ?	7
Well , somebody's gonna have to start trusting somebody .	1
Pick it , boy , pick it !	5
Please , continue .	6
If I let go , I'll fall !	4
Well , I sure do appreciate you boys busting me out .	8
You must not do this thing to him .	1
So that's what you came to see me about ?	7
Yeah ! Yeah ... Yes !	1, 5
You said she was coming with us .	7
Concocted all kinds of false information about weapons of mass destruction which [PERSON] did not have , and it was known in intelligence circles he didn't have .	1, 3
When the boat seemed a safe distance from the shore , I took a spike , and drove it again and again through the planking of the hull .	1
You're the craziest old fool I guess I ever did see .	3
Mom . Nice to see you . - Hello .	2, 5, 7
Oh , Captain , you got to stop this .	8, 6
I wouldn't have believed it .	7
He's not making a whole lot of sense .	3
I've got to get a contract signed .	2
Faster , son , faster !	5
She killed her husband same as if she shot him .	4
Yes . You know the nun you spoke to last night ?	2
Promise me ?	8
I'll bet in no time , we could have a whole new car and everything .	2
So tired .	6
So if you're bad often enough , you'll die .	3
I must speak to Mr [PERSON] .	2
First you waste my time , then you get my name wrong !	1
Hit him with your purse , ya pussy .	3
Take my head and collect your reward	3
It will be difficult for me . Suppose ...	4
Put him in my custody right now !	1
How are you feeling ?	8
Ha ha ! Hi ! Hi , everybody !	5
Bullshit .	1, 7
You can come out now , Red Eagle .	8
That is not true .  	1
You'll tell her how you manipulated the American mood , hmm ?	3
Cover him up , quickly .	4
[PERSON] was my prisoner .	3, 6
He tried to knife me .	4
Cut it out .	1
Why are you dressed like that ?	2, 3, 7
It was nobody's fault but my own .	6
What the fuck are you eating ?	3
And very heavily .	1
Can't I go down to [LOCATION] and get it fixed ?	7
Er , you were arrested for being carried by a motor vehicle taken without consent , and resisting arrest .	3
I thought what was lost .	5
[PERSON] , you got to trust me .	8
On the other hand , they do have some rather nasty habits .	3
Our island is peaceful .	5
They got ta know [PERSON]'s gonna pull out their livers .	1, 3, 6
Must you flirt ?	3
Don't worry if you hear firing .	8
Why , that's right !	5
My God !	7
I bet you're gonna get a big promotion when this thing's over .	5
He's got such gentle eyes .	8
Don't make me shoot you .	1
Tell what ?	2
I can't agree to the terms without the approval of my State Councillor for Foreign Affairs .	4
I don't understand . You're already married .	7
He accused me of selling out .	1, 3
Grimm needs a little reassuring .	8
We'd be pleased if you would .	2, 5
You look really good .	5
Oh , o dear ...	4
We went to the very heart of the vessel ... The propulsion unit .	4, 6
They want a president they know .	8
Don't give me all that sally army stuff .	3
We won three games in a row , [PERSON] .	5
I am here to discuss the so - called flying saucers .	2
Oh , no !	4, 6
Give me the money .	1, 2
Everybody ready ?	2
Like I said , they'll call you if they need you .	1
They're coming to get you , Barbara.[LOCATION] ,	2, 4
No one can feel safe living in a community ... when there are reckless and irresponsible neurotics ... wandering about its thoroughfares armed with deadly weapons .	4
I'm sorry , are we here to have a sarcastic back and forth , or would you like to exchange useful information ?	1
I got enough to put you away for a long vacation . So like it or not , as of now you're working for me , understand ?	1, 3
They murder everything that moves .	4
That's excellent .	8, 2, 5
When Mr [PERSON]'s feet hurt , he drives the whole house crazy .	1
If you don't get married , I'll fire the both of you .	1
When does he ever hear me swear ?	7
What if the Russians were raping your sister ?	3
Flo , if I wanted anything else , I'd call [PERSON] here .	1
But until we figure it out , it may be a good idea for you to stay at home .	4
I told you never to ask me how I feel .	1
Trying to kill me . Is that it ?	1
I'd like you to meet a friend of mine .	8
[PERSON] , you trust me , don't you ?	8
Have you seen any of these documents ?	1
[PERSON] , don't try it .	1
I just hose them off , if she gets on them .	8
Cheers !	2, 5
If we keep our stern to the wind , we'll roll over .	4
Judges need to be educated , the public needs to be educated , the Department of Justice needs to be educated on exactly what's going on here .	6, 7
He's in love .	5
I think he believed me at last .	5
Well , we'd been scouting for what is called delicately a new face .  	2
I'll make it right with you .	1
The job's too tough for you .	3
We are doing our to protect the art .	2
Code red , code red !	4
Now you can show Papa some of them tricks .	2
These guys , they don't do it for money . - What ? - They don't do it for money .	4
You listening ?	2
Who's the dame ?	2
Thank God you answered .	5
It's a monster !	4
It's pretty rough .	6
We belong here .	5
I've got a job to do , but I'm not hard to get along with .	8
We've had wonderful times , we three .	5
[PERSON] was good to me .	8
It took me a week to find this crap .	1, 3, 7
I'm going home with him instead .	5
Must I remind you that you are the fugitive from justice , and not I ?	3
I wish I could spend more than two hours with you .	2, 6
You used to think so too .	8
He took her to a restaurant . Maybe some food would make her feel better .	2, 5
Come on . Let's go ! Let's wrap this thing up .	2
And you must trust me when I say it's likely we're all going to die .	4
We're perfectly in sync , [PERSON] .	8, 5
No , this is my daughter's night . Really . Come on .	1
Why did you say [PERSON]'s better ?	1, 6
Yet neither the husband or anybody else has been in to see her all day .	6
Do not say that .	1
Y' all take care now , you hear ?	8, 4
Can I ask you something ?	8
[PERSON] , the baby ?	7
Isabelle !	5
You weren't on the team the last time we beat you .	7
Nobody goes no place here without I say so .	1
I've just heard a startling piece of news .	4
You know , you're looking at a minimum twenty years ?	3
A sense of humor .	8
As I step into the rat catcher , the first thing I notice , besides the smell of rancid beer and stale piss , is the tension .	3
But I want to know why .	7
Why don't I do this right ?	6
You think of yourself and the one you're in love with .	5
What if the police find you here ?	4
I killed this person for their money , right ?	7
I'm gonna do it now , [PERSON] .	2
Don't you call my husband ...	3
Be careful , you'll put my cigar out .	4
You look like someone who could use a couple of hours ' sleep .	1, 3
Your day is done , old boy .	5
I don't want any connection to this precinct . If you do it , don't do it here .	1, 4
With her bare hands , she just chopped him down !	3, 7
You're wasting yourself on this kid , then hanging us up for nothing .	1
I don't want it .	1, 3
Do Russians never think about life ?	7
The key is , he's an animal .	8
Are you willing to take that chance ?	2
You're hanging your ass out a good long way on this one .	1, 3
I remember once ... we put my mum's canary in the oven .	5
Shit !	1, 3, 4, 7
You seem to me to be what my mother warned me about :	4, 5
Oh , I see .	7
I'll give you a night to remember .	2
I don't want to put you to any trouble .	6
Look , he doesn't work here anymore , so ...	3
It's an expression .	1
We are presenting a performance .	2
Oh , it's just surprising .	7
Anyone can make a mistake .	8
Right now I am just freaking out .	4
We could have backed him up .	6
It still has the keys , Mr. [PERSON] ? - Oui .	2, 7
That's what's the matter with you .	1
But I can't play them with you .	6
It's no good .	6
I forget a lot of things and I. . .	6
No , we can't be disturbed .	1
ve never been to [LOCATION] L.A.[LOCATION] 	6
Well , I can't help wondering if [PERSON] is right .	2, 6
We won't have to worry about our future if you're willing to raffle off your past .	2
I'll be back .	2
I'm not as dumb as you think I am .	8
I'd have to lead them through .	7
Ruuuuuth !	1
I can see very well , thank you .	1, 2
It's impossible . [PERSON] ...	6, 7
It's horrible !	6
Goddamn it , [PERSON] .	1, 3
He cooks better than his ma !	8, 7
What's with those cicadas anyway ?	7
You think I'm beautiful ?	5
They say some of us can turn as late as nine or ten , but I'm past that now so ...	5, 6
Please , [PERSON] .	2, 4, 6
But then , uh ... . You look to me like a gal with a big appetite for everything .	4
The whole town in panic .	4
Please . - Could you get [PERSON] a Coke , please ? - Sure .	8
That's no way to remember him .	6
Oh , God . Where's my wimple ?	4
That wheel is enough to drive anybody crazy .	1
I hope I'm not obscure .	4
This is your friendliest enemy reminding you to take it easy and never volunteer for anything .	5
I got it all planned .	8, 2, 5
If there's any justice , let him get mugged by the man who took my watch !	3
What crap !	1
Freeze !	1, 2
See you around .	2
He's a sneaky little shit just like you , right ?	3
There's [PERSON] and [PERSON] going out to yet another birthday party with their new son !  	2, 5, 7
I might do that .	8, 7
Are you trying to tell me someone's dead , old boy ?	2
She's an awful sweet little thing .	5
That's entirely ... why don't you bring [PERSON] in to make sure the phone gets answered ?	3
They had ...	6
Oh .	7
Let's sing !	2
I thought it was a good speech .	5, 6
All I know is that I'd like to meet a member of the judiciary or a member of Congress that thinks that this situation , the status quo is satisfactory .	1, 3
There were some problems with ...	6
Can you imagine her traveling around the world with a camera bum who never has more than a week's salary in the bank ?	3
And , besides , I'd like to try this case myself .	2
No . [PERSON] is definitely not ' with me  ' . 	3
Who knows ?	1
I didn't say I came to kill anybody , all right ?	2, 4
It's not right to leave it in there .	3, 4, 6
So we might as well have a good time .	5
I appreciate your letting me come .	8
You won't be needing this anymore and I think your boyfriend's had his gut full of races !	1
You might choose your company with better taste .	3
Allow me to get that bag for you .	2, 7
You've no right to think what you do about me .	1
Why don't you kids come for a walk with us ?	2
I'm awfully unhappy , Mom .	6
You're a good person .	8
l should think you would .	8, 2
But if you care about us , you do not do this .	8, 1, 6
She's a wonderful wife to me , too .	5
You come home , you order out food ... and then you play those stupid [PERSON] albums until 2 , in the morning !	3
Lil ' [PERSON] hate you !	1
Are a sound mind and a full belly .	2, 5
Then a wasp stung out my eye .	6
Are you hurt bad , mate ?	8, 7
I - I took some sleeping pills .	4
How dare you , you ... How long has she been in this condition ?	1, 3, 4, 6, 7
This has gone too far now , huh ?	4
Okay , I have to study Returns and Exchanges .	1, 2
I don't feel so wonderful .	6
Is this the admiral's harem ?	3
You may have overlooked the fact that the use of officers for labour is expressly forbidden by the Geneva Convention .	1
Look at you , baby girl ! Hey , you ready to blow this joint or what ?	8, 2, 5, 7
It won't be long now , comrades .	2
One of you better tell the lieutenant that the waterhole I come by this morning is all muddied up .	3
Don't pretend you don't know the reason .	1
You clean up real nice .	7
Yeah , no , no !	4
The things that are done by love !	5, 7
I'm not stupid , OK ?	1, 3
Open the door !	1, 2
Even when we rehearsed it , I felt something sad and tender .	6
Because you were frightened for the safety of yourselves and your unborn child ?	4
Put these in water , blabbermouth !	3
Maybe it's best I do remember .	4
You done it .	5
I mistakenly trusted these demons and slaughtered righteous officials To atone for my sins	6
That's rude .	3
Open it .	2
I'm not wearing pantyhose .	2
I'm just not up to my usual self .	6
My drinking does not interfere with my work .	8
For our ambassador !	1, 2
All of you !	7
We mustn't stop .	4
I have a kid . I have a kid . - Hmm ?	4, 6
I should have taken my chances with the cannibals .	4
OK . Are you ready ?	2
Now , we better start all over .	2
I'm warning you .	1
Let's go have a drink !	2
What the hell were you doing diving there ?	4
Everything that could go wrong was considered .	8
Naughty , Pumpkin !	1
Get on the roof !	4
After last night , I think she's looking forward to it .	2
And when things die , they go some place else .	2
Robbers , plural ?	8
Nothing wild , right ?	4
Peoples , my stomach's been grumbling , but help has arrived .	2
Hey , look at you !	5
I don't know what the bastard expect of me .	3
Seems much slower than the other eight times I've seen it .	7
Hey ! What's up ?	7
I want to talk to you .	8
Except you'll look better in 'em .	5
I want one hero , not two mutineers .	1
Why didn't you tell me about you and [PERSON] ?	1, 2
Exaggerate .	1
Then rising is better .	2
What do you do with yourself in [LOCATION] , [PERSON] ?	8
Was the city trying to strike a deal with the drug lords ?	1, 4, 7
All those bottles , of sizes different , completely in the wrong order ...	1
People used to stop on the street to admire me .	6
Yeah , yeah , I'd like to rent a car Saturday . Yeah .	5
The facing page looks as intellectual as a snake .	3
It's big enough for two .	8
I haven't seen you for a week .	7
Until it took a hit in the head .	1, 4
Down with the King .	1, 3
Stop . I've been told . We're gonna look into it .	1
It's just when you say these things are closing in on me , it's like a nightmare .	4
Playing with amateurs , huh ?	3, 6, 7
With your permission , I'd like to show you something I've had printed .	2
Great pair of togas .	5
I fear that what life remains to me ...	4
You see what I see .	8
The way you say that sounds so ... rote .	1, 3, 6
I could do wonders with your dismembered body .	3
Let's talk reality .	2
Perhaps you are not aware that the bridge is now under my personal command .	1
All right , gentlemen . Stand by .	2
We're looking good here .	5
I'll sit by your side until you're ready .	8, 2
Not very lucky , is he ?	7
[PERSON] , you and [PERSON] give me a hand with this door .	8
Don't you see me standing right here ?	1
Divvy bitch !	1, 3
I was so close .	1
I told him his wife was a dyke .	3
Course they gave him a big hunk of money for a settlement . Don't nobody know how much it was .	3
I want to speak ...	2
Ten years of tap dancing lessons and this is how you repay me ?	3
True , but the soldiers would kill us before we got to the river .	4
Let me feed you .	8
It's tough being left out , isn't it ?	6
Looks like trouble ahead .	4
Without a wind , we'll lose him !	4
Well , nobody asked you to .	1
They were looking at me .	4
Close your mouth , dear .	1
They say he's got a brain .	1, 3
You've chosen the right agent , sir .	8
I'm good at it .	5
What the hell's going on down there ?	1, 2
They're quite merciless .	4
Please don't go .	4, 6
She won't , and you'll be unhappy .	1, 3
But if it's straight - up one - to - one you want , then I'm your man .	8
And she got in a car accident .	6
I got the address of this [PERSON] , and I went to see her this morning . Really early .	2, 5
we can work something out . - That's a sweet offer , but not now .	2, 5
You see that man giving screwface to [PERSON] ?	2, 3, 6, 7
Just another white guy waiting for the train .	3
Will you come too ?	2
They refused to even participate .	1, 6
So , do you need me to try to remember something ?	2
Something's missing .	4
I wan na thank you for what you're doin' for my son , [PERSON] .	8
I don't want your tomatoes !	1
I'm an honest businessman , a good husband and a father .	8
You get around on those wheels pretty good .	8, 2, 7
Why have you come back when nobody wants to see you ?	3
A gunfight .	4
The woman is safe . I've contacted the Canadian authorities . They'll be here any minute .	5
They'd go to Congress and get more funding .	6
I'm sorry , Grandfather . I've got to get some air .	3, 6
[PERSON] equals [PERSON] .  This is [PERSON]'s handwriting . 	7
It's dangerous , but it just might work .	2
All I can do is release you to make your own estimate of the situation .	8
It won't hurt you , kid .	8
Fucking six ...	1
You've been drinking again , haven't you ?	3
You're a fucking bastard !	3
A desecration of what used to be the finest .	6, 7
It was no self - defense , [PERSON] took him out .	1, 6, 7
Pay attention to me .	1
Could you do it for me today , please ?	8
Don't have a boyfriend ?	2
It won't take that long .	8
Anything unusual ?	2
It's okay . It's okay .	5
Lunch was wonderful .	5
Okay , you have fun .	5
All right , is that a beautiful city or what ?	5
I'd never have taken the job if I hadn't wanted to keep us all together .	8
So you just hang out and keep a look at kids ?	3, 7
Well , what do I care .	1, 6
We are winning ' the friggin' game !	5
Stop talkin' and start drinkin' .	2
Just a walk in the park .	2, 5
Forget it !	1
What a waste of talent .	6
Fire !	4
Nobody's betrayed you .	8
You hadn't seen him in years , and yet you say he was an old friend .	7
It means we can get back before [PERSON] gets home .	2
And if there was , I sure as hell wouldn't tell you , colonel .	1
They're maniacs .	3, 4
Do you want to know everything ?	6
You know the rules about smoking .	1
I thought I'd lost the ability . With you , I. ...	5, 7
[PERSON] , now you must get married .	2
We've simply got to convince you that you're going to serve the right cause .	8
They're out there .	1, 4
The war in [LOCATION] .	6
Stay here ?	8, 2
Congratulations , Rock ...	1
The chauffeur ? The stable boy ?	7
I'm just as old as I look .	6
But inevitably , there comes a time for waking up , even for us .	2
I knew someone would get killed , but nobody listened .	1, 4, 6
I'm gonna speak to your ma !	1
Not good . Let's not get caught in the car .	4
lt was [PERSON] . - How do you - l tailed him .	7
I am varsity captain as a freshman .	8
Heavy reading for a young man .	8
What will happen to you after I've gone ? They like hearing my stories	6
Mom , are we in [LOCATION] yet ?	2
I'll make a special journey just to talk about myself .	2
Shit ! [PERSON]'s got a streamer !	1
I don't think you hear very well . I am not testifying at this trial .	1, 4
I'll make friends and enemies to please myself .	1
What's his name again ?	7
You look like an honest man .	8
Yeah , that's it .	5
I wanted good things for you .	8, 6
Just throw our hats in the air .	8, 4
Don't do anything foolish .	3
It's not safe .	4
I think the answers make you wise , but the questions make you human .	8
I'll be damned .	7
They cast me in a prison , and when they failed ...	4
There's somethin' I want to show you .	2
How much do you think he heard ?	4
All my failings were preparations for meeting you .	6
That's good .	8, 2, 5
I can say no more .	6
That's good . Seven' fines  ' since we left the match . 	5
I'm so pissed at you ! I'm really pissed , OK ?	1, 3, 6
Hundreds and thousands of them died .	6
At that rate , we only have three weeks .	4
You're just as selfish as he is .	3
I'll tell my mother !	1
Better open this door , [PERSON] .	1
I must be working out some screwed - up karma .	1
We're running out of time .	1
I'm the last installment and that troubles me .	6
But it's wonderful .	5
It's useless .	3
I happen to like [PERSON] .	5
Get it and no one'll get hurt .	1
[PERSON] is okay , he's done all right for us .	8
You know , there's no alcohol in water .	8, 2, 3
I hit him . He went down .	8
I think my dog's escaping .	4
It's for your own good .	8
I want to kill you .	1
And you wouldn't want to endanger Mr. [PERSON] , would you ?	1, 2, 4
What the fuck are they doing in there ?	1, 7
It's a bit humiliating , always borrowing [PERSON]'s place .	6
And I'll have every gunboat in the Navy hunting ' ole Nemo .	1, 2
All hands to rescue stations !	1, 2, 4
In fact , I admire the style of you .	5
I'm trying , you know it really upsets me .	6
I'm afraid I'm not a very good host .	6
Go call your pimp to look after you !	3
I can't believe it !	1, 7
Tell him he's too tough for me .	1
I think you really love me .	5
You know . sometimes it feels like it's the only thing keeping us together .	6, 7
What the hell's going on here ?	1, 7
If you hadn't fixed the radio , we wouldn't know about the train .	8
Hey , look who's here !	7
Creeps .	3
It's my fault .	6
Tonight , we will feast in his honour .	2
I'll accept that .	5
Don't worry about it .	8
Get them !	1, 2, 7
Okay . You're kidding , right ?	7
I'm getting tired of this .	1
Don't be so sentimental , [PERSON] .	1
I can't wait to see their faces light up .	2
You'd prefer the parents dead , too .	3
Don't ask me why .	1
Despite our power the few of us would be busy indefinitely trying to suppress a large , hostile population .	4
I know how you feel .	8, 6
I don't think I've ever been so thrilled in my life .	5
For three months , we've been listening to that sad sack spout his unhinged tirades , day in and day out , because we were promised % of the ransom .	3
She's in the bathroom .	1
Hey , look .	7
Her cunt .	3
Come down . - It's making you nervous ?	2, 4
Sounds great . I don't think she's taking us that seriously .	5
I hate the British !	1
I was just trying to tidy up .	1
Get up , you son of a bitch , cos [PERSON] loves ya .	8, 5
I've had it up to here .	1
We certainly are , senorita , because we understand you got a lot of talent .	2, 5
Get outta here , you goddamn parasite .	3
Come clean right now . Uh ...	4
This starved duck ?	3
Are you really that quiet ?	3
[PERSON] , could I have a word with you ?	4
I'm afraid I've disappointed you .	6
Yeah , that would be good .	5
Okay , that didn't help at all .	6, 7
I'm gonna kill it .	1, 2, 3
I shall miss you too .	6
Now , don't tell me Shooter's your oldest and best friend .	3, 7
No , I stay with you .	8
But a little more of your stupid behavior and even the respectability of my house won't shield you .	3
My unit's due to be shipped out soon .	6
The Belgian of the village ?	7
Put this on .	2
We were licked , weren't we ?	3, 7
Ah , thank you .	5
[PERSON] was killed .	6
Look , I'm sorry to drop by unannounced .	6
Now , please , tell me what I can do .	2
Why look at me that so strangely ?	4, 7
I'm going to answer whatever questions the inspector wishes to ask me .	8
Sounds awful , doesn't it ?	6
If they do come here , you will let me know ?	2
Rather like a picnic , isn't it ?	5
You're a rare specimen	7
Oh , my God , no , I can't be bleeding again .	4, 7
An Earthling to save the Childlike Empress !	2, 5
I will not ever sit on those eggs !	1, 3
Then what are you gonna come home to ?	6
That's pretty sweet , right ?	5
I don't want to take up too much time .	2
Yeah . I'm okay .	8
Assure [PERSON] that he'll be in our prayers .	8
Give him $ .	1, 2
We'll discuss it later , whenever you're ready .	2
Mommy ! Mom !	8, 5, 7
This magnificent structure will be the seat of leadership for the new [LOCATION] .	2, 5
I have to take a bus .	1
I'm sorry to disturb you .	6
You want a job ?	8
Here are the keys !	7
Yeah , well , who knew ? - God damn .	1
We've got to get this man off the floor .	4
Everything else stops ...	4
Can we have coffee ?	2
Every last drop .	2, 5
Why do men think marriage is the only thing we want ?	1, 3, 6
Come on , you're kidding me , right ?	7
Don't you see what's happening ? If you don't find me a killer , there is no fucking office !	1
[PERSON] , this is [PERSON] .	8
If you die , your type will be extinct	6
My , and you did your spring house - cleaning all in one day .	7
A depressing characteristic .	6
Have you no recollection of a conversation with [PERSON] ?	2
I sponsored him in the Senate .	8
Looks like I got an abdominal and a thigh . - Dress it . Quickly .	1, 7
Yet men have killed and proved a reason ... and been set free .	3
And he waded in there with a lead pipe and he saved your ass and now you're going to deny him over his dead body ?	1
Yo , [PERSON] !	2, 5, 7
We've cut the target adrift .	2
You think I got this job because I fucked some fat - cat friend of [PERSON]'s .	1
A man was killed in his plane and bled all over him .	4
Scramble the best spin team we have .	2, 5
Suck on that . Hey , who's there ?	7
And I just disagreed with them , completely .	3
Embarrassing , Your Majesty ?	4
There is so somewhat to do .	2
The thing is , [PERSON] , we lost a little time .	4
I'm staying .	2
Did I hear something about jewels ?	7
How about some more mint juice ?	2
Here . . euros .	8
I'm prepared to make a donation to the people of this town .	8
When do I get the money ?	2
Pleasure meeting you .	5
It's somehow able to bend light .	7
My good [PERSON] , the Lady Inglethorp is killed and it is necessary to know everything to be able to avenge it .	1, 2
No , no , no , no , no .	1, 4, 6
There's the finest deerskin jacket I've ever seen .	5
Now I know exactly what you think of me , and why .	3
Might as well be a hundred .	3, 4
You took [PERSON]'s body .	3
I declare , [PERSON] , sometimes I think you got psychic powers .	4, 7
Would you have preferred the Verua kill me ?	1, 6, 7
OK .	8, 1, 3, 6
It sounds frightening .	4
Say bye - bye , now . Bye to daddy .	6
Isn't it hideously plain to the naked eye I'm in love with you ?	1
It don't do nothing for me .	1
God , I've got ta be with her , at least till she learns my name .	2
And that they wouldn't hold Backpage responsible was very disturbing to me .	1
He is very talented .	5
Give it back .	2
You're harming them psychologically .	3
Cam , stop !	4
I'd say you were the only man I ever loved .	6
Better ?	2
Your breath stinks of it .	3
Did you see what he did ?	7
You humiliated him again .	3
You ?	7
It's been an honor to serve with you .	8
No man is gonna make a liar out of me , sir .	1
Oh , macaroni and cheese . - Same old story .	6
His life means nothing .	3, 6
I can suggest something ... ?	2, 4
Is it really him ?	7
He is the owner of [LOCATION] .	8, 7
Fucking cops !	4
She never even went back to the room .	6
Some of them are carved in stone , some of them men like [PERSON] put up there , so suckers like me could read them .	6
We like it .	5
Look what I found !	2
Get out of here , before I make you beg for your life .	1
[PERSON] , look at me !	1
[PERSON] , through you , we have learned that they seek plunder , not justice .	8
Why , you want a road trip ?	1
Let me go with you .	2
Where does that put us ?	2
I'm . . I no m. . mean to .	4
Are you confessing to this ?	1
They're harmless , friendly , and , by all reports , extremely intelligent and sophisticated .	5
I respect you .	8
A dead animal !	4, 7
I thought I was the best stud - poker player in the world .	6
If you don't tell the truth , I can't help you .	1
I mean , I realize you don't have to answer me , but don't forget I helped you into this world , okay ?	8, 4
I know his voice well enough .	8
Why did the inspector allow me to say all those things ?	7
I feel I should be doing something , but I don't know what .	6
What's going on ?	4, 7
Thanks , [PERSON] .	8, 5
Why is he driving ?	7
TV and press only . You'll have to step back .	1
I don't think anything we can do would be of the slightest use .	6
Spectacles , testicles , wallet and watch .	2
This is called inbreeding from which comes idiot children ... and more lawyers .	3
I told you not to pick up the phone .	1
The little people identify with you .	5
I was looking after your interests .	8
What is not going to be easy ?	3, 6, 7
I've had just about enough of you two .	1, 3
[LOCATION] is nice in the spring .	5
You'll see the women in [LOCATION] . They're the most beautiful in the world .	2, 5
With her , it would be marriage or nothing , and that's out of the question .	1
Don't forget me , [PERSON] .	8, 6
Ringo ! 	5
It's hard to believe about [PERSON] .	7
[PERSON] , you fool !	3
Really scary .	4
I think you're perfect .	5
Damn it , stay back here .	1, 4
And I hope that someday you will join me here .	2
You injured your knee in a game .	4
My kids can stay with me for as long as they would like .	5
Where are you from ?	2
They look like they've come to a funeral .	6
Why should I take the chance that I lose it ?	7
I bet that was fun .	8, 2, 3, 5
Sweetheart , look what just came in the mail for you .	8, 2, 5
What brings you back so early ?	7
Witness interviews ?	7
That bitch has messed around with me .	3
How do you plan to pass if you're too busy stealing cars And shooting black people ?	1, 3
You always do .	8, 5
But in fact the level was dangerously low .	4
What beast are you talking about ?	2
You're ruining it !	1
All the Nuke you'll ever need .	2, 4
And , [PERSON] , we have a breathtaking adventure in front of us .	2
I thought I liked to party , but these guys ...	6, 7
Nothing to worry about .	2
It's time to update the program and I would like to hear from each one of you .	2
I called and called . - Where were you last night ?	8, 1
I think a [PERSON] would be good enough .	8
It's for you , the famous [PERSON] .	8, 2, 5
I'll see you downstairs .	8
That's sweet .	5
I never mentioned any illness .	7
You know that the child of two primitive apes will never learn how to speak .	3
They are perfectly safe .	8
Alright , have it any way you want !	1, 3
How ' bout a drink ?	8, 5
Does that sign say BQE ?	5
I'm dreaming !	5, 7
Because he's the future .	8, 5
Please ...	4
And you found out ?	7
It's very funny , [PERSON] . Don't move !	5
I'm actually beginning to like them .	7
As soon as I get it , we'll make tracks .	2
I do declare , it looks like my head's gonna split open with all this singing and yelling and hallelujah - ing .	1
Can we have [PERSON] ?	2
We don't want [PERSON] to come , the bald giant with stupid sunglasses , knocking everybody around for kicks .	3
You know , I'm thinking of training you for cashier . Really ?	8, 5
[PERSON] had a great time .	5
He got kicked upstairs .	7
But I just laughed and begged them to keep on doing it !	5
You dreamt I lost some weight ?	7
It's so nice out there .	5
And treat those two impostors Just the same ...  	1
I want you to make a little phone call for me .	8
I just said , I love you .  	1
We got ta let him out !	1, 4
I know , but we have so much love to give .	8, 5
I don't care about [PERSON] !	1
Let us board !	5
Well done , young man !	5
You'll regret this !	1
For a celebrated bounder , that is an awful admission .	3
Something's going on .	4
There's somebody at the door .	7
God ?	2
Seemed worried about it .	4
Very well , sir .	8
I'm not surprised . Me , too .	1, 4, 6
Daddy , there are balloons floating away .	6
The helicopter was destroyed , and the pilot is dead .	6
Oh , I think not .	1, 7
And I feel sick about it .	3
Got a chance of a job there ?	2
Please hurry .	4
I mean , we're a solid act , honey .	5
Do we have to sit with them ?	3, 4
Nice .	5
And we've got her .	8, 5
Going to have dessert when we finish our hot dog ?	2
And then three weeks ago I suffered a nervous breakdown .	6
I wouldn't think of such a thing !	7
And without [PERSON] , it's better to let these people with the black suits and the Swiss haircuts worry about things you and I don't begin to understand .	3
Everything's going to be alright , son .	8
I can't beat three sevens .	8
Isn't this exciting ?	2, 5
Then you'll have to have permission .	1
You could run a few thousand volts through him .	1, 2
I'm surprised at you !	7
Don't give us hunches .	6, 7
What's killing all the children ?	4
I'll wait for you upstairs .	2
Has been infected with a new strain typhoid ?	3
That is some wonderful horse . - Congratulations .	5
She's more frightened than anything .	4
Get her back for me , please .	4, 6
[PERSON] , I have the most terrible news for you .	6
You've got a woman here ?	7
You know , come to think of it , It is a rather interesting conception .	7
You return to the front of your army .	1
Good boy , good boy .	8
And there's not a damn thing you can do about it , you understand me ?	1, 6
What I want you to do is go over to your church , get crosses , and prayer books , and Bibles , and whatever the hell else you people use .	2, 4
I thought you'd be old .	7
He tied her up ... He beat her with some instrument and strangled her .	4
Well , I've been trying to reach him all day .	1
You shouldn't fool with that .	1
The greatest health threat facing our nation .	4, 6
That's a real woman .	5
You come with me , alone , and we leave in minutes .	8, 2
I'm glad you're here to see nothing goes wrong .	8
Well , there's no mistaking this German beer .	8, 2
Why don't you tell the truth for once ?	3
What's Zharkov doing on the plane ?	7
I dig and dig , and the hole gets no bigger .	6
More ! - More ?	7
You're up early , Mr. President .	7
[PERSON] continued to invade your privacy .	1
I'm gettin' me a gun , some liquor and a gold commissioner .	2
Do not .	6, 7
Hey , babe , you playin' cards ?	2
All that money , [PERSON] ?	7
What'll we drink to ?	2
Don't you stay up too late , OK ?	8, 5
Who would want to live in a graveyard ?	3, 7
Well , I don't . And I don't need this .	1
That's quite a knife you carry .	4
It has been such a tremendous excitement for me , this visit .	5
What the fuck you doing ?	1, 4
Fuck [LOCATION] .	1, 3
It's more than my job's worth !	1, 7
Hell , we could bring in the whole god damn New York Knicks just to make sure your trash hits the basket ! How's that ?	1
Oh , this is a Kandinsky !	7
You're not going to hang me ?	7
That's me ! '	2, 5
Don't we like [PERSON] ?	7
[PERSON] , break out that chart we've been working on .	2
I don't like my boys getting hurt permanently .	6
I do hate you !	3
Nobody knows how to talk , just grunt at each other .	6
Get out of my office .	1
That's your funeral .	3
One more to go , chicken .	1
Good luck to you .	8
[PERSON] , we have to go downstairs quickly !	1, 2
Shut up and put your hat on !	1
I think you tell better jokes than me , [PERSON] .	8
I'm sorry about the shoes .	6
He was the sanest man I ever knew .	8
What a tool !	7
Come on . Go , just go .	1
She had a bit of an accident back there .	4
I never scouted this neighborhood .	7
I got ta get back . Move it back !	4
You still race ?	2
But the water was dangerously low ?	4
What , are you smuggling furs or something ?	7
Well , he was old enough to be your father .	3
I'd rather die .	1, 3, 6
Yeah , but you're fucking doing it .	1
Don't fucking kill him , we've got business to sort out !	1
It'll be there .	8
I've told you that a dozen times .	1
I was bored to death .	1
Everyone has baggage they bring to a relationship .	6
They have every right to invade ours .	1
I will be punished , and I should be punished .	4
No scars .	2, 5
I'd rather take a whipping than mend fences .	6
I'll kill you .	1
You're mistaken if you think I'm leaving her here ... with a mother who doesn't consider her reputation .	3
Hello , sweet thing .	5
I'll come by , like , : ?	2
Don't be a fool .	3
Oh , wait .	2
We're friends !	8
Nobody understands us .	6
I want to show you something .	2
Eat shit !	1
For God's sake , be careful .	4
[PERSON] , where's the kid ?	1
A lovely shade of green !	5
Watch where you drive , artist .	3
And how is that different than all the times you risked me ?	1
We didn't hear that .	4
You murdering fool !	3
You were going to give me that statue .	2, 6
When did this relationship take place between [PERSON] and [PERSON] ?	2, 3, 7
What do you think ? Yeah , that's it .	2
Will succeed .	8
You take a rest now .	8
One cop per car ?	2
[PERSON] is two minutes late .	1
Who do you think you are butting in like this ?	1
Who bow and smile and scrape and spend their nights gnawing the chairs and floors out from under us all .	3
You reckon this'll make the colonel happy ?	2
They must've wiped this place clean .	7
If I thought I needed an assistant to do my job ... meaning what ?	1
[PERSON] , I might have died a happy man .	6
I don't know what caused this great interest in us ?	2, 7
I thought we were friends .	6
He thinks the world of me .	5
Give a girl a chance to breathe .	1
And the sociopaths that are in control of those programs can't be allowed to speak for planet [LOCATION] .	1, 3, 4
It's a crime against the people who sent me here ! We are on an official mission ... and we have no right to change the orders of our superiors .	1
No ! Windy !	4, 6
You're suffering from small eyes and fat asses .	3
If we had known , we would have greeted you with flowers .	6
Get back here !	1, 2
[PERSON] ! You thick - headed chunk of fish - bait !	1, 3
[PERSON] , they weren't taking any chances !	3, 6, 7
It is well .	5
Get him in the corridor .	3
They wouldn't let you take your dog ?	7
I was wondering what we might expect , in terms of your testimony .	2
In the reprisal for the shelling of our homes and the murder of our families by American warships .	8, 4
Silver snow falling on the ship .	5
Best news I heard all year .	5
Have you thought that your child is in the [LOCATION] ?	2
This is nice .	5
You know what we're fighting out there , and they know it !	8, 2
Get these men out of here .	1
But I told you never to fight a street fighter fight .	3, 6
There is something strange about that boy !	7
You need money , and quickly .	4
Let's see !	2
My ambition is to win all your contracts , own this club and run it my way .	2
Leave it to me . I'll tell you .	8
The one that you and [PERSON] ditched .	6, 7
He's ready for a fall .	3, 4, 5
Listen , I - I know you're gonna think this is real dumb of me , but , uh , I haven't been feeling very good lately , and , uh ...	2
You get beaten though , don't you ?	4
When [PERSON] got seriously ill , you sent her to a home .	6
They'll never believe us .	1, 4, 6
I want to leave Mr Case's employment .	2, 6
I had the pleasure of meeting you in your beautiful shop .	5
My friends and I would like to party with five of your girls in [LOCATION]'s Pen .	2
[LOCATION] has always been able to crack your neck .	1
Sorry I was suspicious .	6
I don't know anything about being a commander .	4
Oh , God , it even has a barn .	7
But my problem is , there's a terrible crime committed today and I haven't told the police .	2, 4
That's normal . That's what she should be doing .	8, 5
Besides , whoever marries her will rule the entire kingdom .	8
I wonder if I could remind the [PERSON] of his promise ... that I might speak to him at any time ?	2
Then we can't let him get away again .	1
I've never before known anyone who was really brave .	6
Don't think my Pa was a pervert then .	1
We've got to keep ... Keep daddy happy .	6
I'll do everything I can to make a success of it .	2
That's the man that eats people	3
For what ?	1
That was our only way of finding out what was going on !	1, 6
Cause I said so .	1
Who is she ?	7
It's a shame , isn't it ?	3, 6
I would want no one else .	8, 2, 5
Let's find something to eat .	2
Stand here and argue .	1
We're not going to plant anything , if that's what you're worried about .	1, 7
For a start , I think I need a new doorman .	2, 5
The question is abusive .	3
See you later , darling .	8, 5
Listen , a special envoy is coming from [LOCATION] today .	2
That task force is headed this way .	4
Dangerous . Probably a serial killer .	4
Emotionally , she's a child .	1
Aye , yous like to call yourselves opportunists instead of anarchists .	1
You must have some idea where he was going .	8
No , no . - No interference from us , right ?	3
And we are no longer victims of this violent , convulsive act , which so debased women and betrayed men .	3
I don't believe it !	1
Cannonball !	5
Let's hope it holds out .	2
Boy , am I tired !	6
And if there's anything else you want , just holler .	8
We can talk about it tonight .	8, 5
Champagne , [PERSON] !	5
Keep your men here !	1
One of the waiters tells me she's got quite a reputation for not mingling .	8, 7
Listen , I really can't talk about this over the phone .	4
You've all won first prize .	5
Kind of reckless of you .	3
I'm sure glad we've run into you .	5
Is anyone down there ?	4
I was lucky I come across her last .	7
It's always nice to see you .	5
I hope you know that .	5
You have to come and see us as soon as we get back .	2
We're not all masochists .	3, 6
No one wants to fly with you .	1
Since I'm a one - man show around here , I think I'll forgive myself this one time ...	8, 6
Can I have your gun , please ?	8
You get in your compartment , shut the door and lock it .	1
I'll win something .	2
I can still smell her aroma .	6
I don't like to .	6
We're partnering on a project .	8
Well , just 'cause I'm hungry . - I'm gonna get something to eat .	5
Let's try this ...	2
We've been doin' real good .	5
I want you to look how the moonlight cuts through the trees .	5
I'll see to it .	2, 5
They sure have all the right equipment .	8
And I cried the whole time .	6
You're more resilient than I gave you credit for .	8
I see them coming , baby I'm throwing myself in the fucking ocean !	4
It was awful !	6
Rocky , up !	2
Now if we want to survive we've got to fight back , we can't hide anymore .	8, 1, 2, 4
You're a month early for the book fair .	7
No , nothing .	6, 7
It cheered me up infinitamente .	5
How can I help you ?	8, 5
Stop putting on that gear !	1, 7
[PERSON] ! Welcome back .	5
But they actually had a very thin but tight fitting suit on .	6, 7
One time , I , uh , I lost my car .	6
But the way this one exploded required some type of detonator .	4
Besides I can't -- l can't afford to lose bucks .	4
Fracture that whole part of the world , and now we have ISIS .	4
All I heard was trash talk .	6
Spare some change ? No .	2, 6, 7
Want me to be his .	2
I really missed you .	6
I'm sick .	6
You and [PERSON] will be doing the dirty crockery alone this evening .	3
You take pleasure in torturing people !	3
This is beautiful .	5
Another break - in by some ... Sex - crazed man .	1
Fucking cops always forget something .	1, 3
And Spider Man died kind of slow .	6
Is that so far from your desire ?	7
Home sweet home .	5
We'll see you out there .	2
We're going to fix that .	8
Don't burn yourself , [PERSON] .	4
You're men !	1, 3, 4, 7
And in my first days , I will reach across party lines and devote my administration , your government , to securing them .	2
[PERSON]'ll hear !	2
Why would they arrest you , Father ?	7
We whispered your names when we were kids ... scared to say them out loud .	4
Oh tots !	2, 5
They believe they're destined for great things , just like many of you .	2
Now , the police are gonna want me to let some of you go as a sign of good faith .	1, 3, 6
Might not get another chance .	6
I'm beginning to like it .	2, 5
You have the most unusual name , too .	7
You worked with [PERSON] , [PERSON] and them guys ?	2
That's right , home girl ,	5
He's lying .	8, 1, 3
Maybe you're right .	8
She's going to die if you don't help me .	4
Our soldiers are dying in the inferno to be burning tanks .	4
Now , listen , stow the chatter , mate , and get on that banjo .	2
We don't want none of his gratitude !	1
We ought to take advantage of every moment .	5
It can't be that difficult .	1
You give me no choice but to ground you .	1, 4
To some very interesting Armenian food .	2
I know . I miss him too .	6
There's some problems .	4
How dare you , sir !	1
Yes , I'll be with you in a minute , Mr. [PERSON] !	2
Any guy who says he can fence $ 50,000 , is crazy .	7
You're drinking the good stuff .	5
Attention !	1, 2
I am glad you are better .	5
In your world if The Neverending Story is fading no child will ever know about Junior .	6
I'll get you loose . - It's a trap .	8
What do you call it ?	1
No , I don't like it .	3, 6, 7
The only ones who see a UFO on TV programs are the rednecks .	1, 3
I hate you all .	1
Thank you for making me a Human Being .	8
Mind if we ask who the hell you are ?	1
I'll go back to [LOCATION] and be a Fuller Brush girl .	2
Everything's fine .	5
You'd rather be found dead with two small children in [LOCATION] ?	4
Did [PERSON] really play here ?	7
I've waited a long time for this .	2
Let me in !	1, 4
You really are afraid of this place .	8, 2, 7
Give me a yell when you want me to unlock the door .	8
Your face ... which tells me how much you don't want to be here .	4
Feels like we're going down .	4
Pablo !	1
Come on , we don't wan na miss our bus .	2
Your niece will have no trouble meeting the Queen's requirements .	8
[PERSON] talked him out of it .	5
All the flight crew is ... either dead or ... or badly injured .	4
Only I didn't create 'em , I heard about 'em from other people .	6, 7
[PERSON] , I'm disappointed in you . Hiding under a nest while [PERSON] needs help .	1, 6
It's OK .	8
I'm sorry , I just made a mistake .	8, 4, 6
I told her you didn't fuck around .	8

Think he gives a damn about me if the watch backfires ?	1, 3, 6
I can do anything .	5
Manchester has a good drummer .	8, 5
But , I , after spending years I found not a shred of evidence that we have alien visitors in our skies .	3
I can't wait .	2
Doesn't a doctor have to do that ?	7
Get out of the god damn hallway , [PERSON] .	1
She's a beautiful tough cookie .	5
All the officers were disloyal .	1, 3, 6, 7
A safety - first Clyde .	8, 5
Mr. [PERSON] , it seems that [PERSON]'s mother was murdered by [PERSON]'s father .	7
Come on , buddy .	2
That's how it works .	1, 2, 5
l hate this part .	1
Isn't that what's wrong with the world today ?	6
I'll make [LOCATION] look like a little place where the monks live .	1, 3
What can he do ?	2
Soon as we get to [PERSON]'s , we'll sleep then .	2
You took him !	1, 6, 7
We don't want advantages , and we don't want prejudices .	1
I don't understand what's going on today .	4, 6, 7
[PERSON] is taken .	4, 6
Deadly and poisonous .	4
It's as empty as ashes .	6
And the only way we got of holding 'em off is by getting together .	8
[PERSON] , I've got something really big for you .	2
I feel another song coming on .	2
You're fucking stabbing me in the back , man .	3
Are you just about finished ?	1
Let's try to figure the whole thing out .	8
Come on up .	2
Very funny .	5
How are we supposed to raise that kind of money ?	1, 2
How kind .	8
Please , you have to let me go .	4
But he's the best cameraman I know .	8
Even though we were close , even though you betrayed me , and I trusted you , I would never harm you .	8, 5
And I don't like nobody touching my stuff !	3
I didn't mean to hurt you .	6
You can't come in .	1
Decker won't tell anyone .	8
I thank you all for your continued service .	8, 5
[PERSON] didn't even look at me .	7
I said some bad things about the boy , but we can explain that to the exuberance and excitement of youth , because he's certainly changed his ways now .	5
Aren't you going with [PERSON] ?	2, 7
I'm blowing this place .	1
You see what a good wife she is ?	5
Do you know [PERSON] , our ambassador there ?	2, 5

I want to help out people that I like .	2, 5
What is more sensitive than the development of the hydrogen bomb prior to its detonation ?	4

Poor little rich boy .  	1, 3
We look forward to ...	2
Just married .	5
Mommy shoulda ' taught you to knock .	1
Got it .	8
Death comes closer for us all .	4
Sorry , nothin' but beer .	6
They can't fire both of us , right ?	4
I was more frightened than the defendant .	4
We're your family now , [PERSON] .	8
What's got into you ?	1, 7
But [PERSON] is gone .	6
I didn't even recognize her .	7
Me too .	2, 5
I don't want any more of it .	1, 2, 3
You're gonna be alright .	8
All I ever do is try to make you happy .	6
He'll show up .	2
Lads , they're drunk .	3
You'll do your housework , eat chocolates , take care of the kid and you'll put on or pounds .	3
They took the one with the collar ?	1, 4, 6, 7
You knew how I felt .	6
It seems that we are forced to admit that our suspicions are wrong , despite her confession .	1, 3
Go away ! I won't let it happen .	3
It's no big deal .	8
It's superficial .	3
What about you ?	2, 7
This is too weird .	3
What must it be before you're satisfied with it ?	1
I'll get my dinner .	2
Like an old boot .	3
You're getting out .	7
The sun's still high , you can try it again .	5
Don't you ever say that to me again .	1, 3
You think you're fast over land I'll go underground !	3
I am glad to see you .	5
Some creep got into her place and strangled her .	1
Forgive me .	6
He reached out to us and asked if we'd be willing to help him	5
Are you quite certain this place was full of people only a few minutes ago ?	7
Black powder and worse ...	3
Oh , m done rehearsing . 	5
Hey , [PERSON] .	2, 5, 7
What happened ?	2, 4, 7
That's the way this business is run .	8, 5
But we like to be on a first - name basis with potential candidates .	8
You sit and discuss your sports and your young ladies and ...	3
Four , this is Leader . Is he gonna be a problem ?	1, 2
There's gonna be a great deal that we're gonna be able to accomplish , the three of us .	2, 5
Since you're their representatives , I can tell you that I'm prepared , right now , to give you a [PERSON] .	8
Why did you do it ?	6, 7
I'll have something to say about that .	1
Yeah , ever since , uh , [PERSON] joined the firm , he's been trying to marry me off .	6
Why didn't you tell me before ?	1
Nobody messes with the Healys !	1
It was bloody marvellous .	5
Let's see who the real chicken is .	2
There was no more innocence anywhere .	8, 6
This is just plain suicide , sir .	4
For [PERSON]'s sake !	1, 7
We'd better go or we'll miss the movie .	2
We won .	5
The government's got enough on its hands already without ...	3
I'm telling you , sir , you've got to put a stop to him now .	4
I need you so much .	8
We were just going to dance .	2
Tell me what I must do !	8
It's admirable .	5
I fed it and put it on .	5
I'm an American citizen , buddy !	1
I'll ask you straight .	1, 2, 4
And you're amazing and this would be amazing .	8, 5, 7
Well , as long as you feel that way about it , the gun is yours !	8
There's too much loss of life and property damage possible .	3, 6
You tryin' to adopt a kid ?	7
God damn , I better not see her naked on payday .	3
Those girls ! Wild drivers , sports cars !	5, 7
Now , you - you don't understand , [PERSON] .	1
[PERSON] !	1, 4, 5, 7
I'd love to .	2, 5
Oh no , I think that's a big mistake . I think you should do it .	8, 2
Just a little more , a little further ...	2
Gus , I thought you were going to attend to that later .	7
He embezzled five million euros and [PERSON] was going to expose him ?	4, 7
And you're gonna ask me questions .	2, 4
We'll give him the biggest gunfight ever .	1
( laughs ) I hope isaac is a deep sleeper .	2
That is a menace .	1
Yours ?	8
I didn't like it .	6
I sit here and I can't believe that it happened .	7
And I'd like to get to know all of you by having you write down your name , address , your home and work phone on paper , and passing it forward .	2
Well , really , you must do something about that memory of yours .	1
And I'll get even better after the wedding .	2
Fool .	1
Well , guess what , mother , I did it to get away from you .	3
Ripping out phones , urinating on desks .	3, 7
Okay ? ,	2
I want you to get me a quart of beer , Miller High Life .	2
In front of millions . That didn't stop [PERSON] . [PERSON] , remember ...	8, 2
That's very interesting .	5
Okay , so all we need to do is get that message out , and ...	8, 2
Go home !	1
We're gonna freeze to death .	4
They're fuckin' horrible - lookin' .	3
I just said , let's have some lunch .	2
Get on !	1
A vast area would be uninhabitable , with many cancer cases later .	4
I'm sure you want to be getting home .	8
You forgive yourself .	8
I appreciate it .	5
I'll step you around this town like you've never been stepped before .	2
Murdered angels don't go to Heaven .	6
Excellent !	5, 7
There you go .	8, 5
Ah , ah , I'm so sorry . [PERSON] has nothing to do with this .	8, 3, 6
Don't joke .	1
[PERSON]'s people were ready to go , but the FSB replaced the crew .	1
Hey , chief .	2
What about staying alive !	4, 7
Hey , I bet you'd look good in one too .	8, 2, 5
I'll take you home .	8
Well , I can have a word with you .	8
Your services are no longer needed .	2
Will you take me away from here ?	2
I'm sure you'll be glad to know that law and order has come to [LOCATION] .	5
I respect your new life .	8
I really belong in jail .	6
I was so alone , and suddenly you were there .	6
The water's great !	5
It's cold .	3, 6
With this strike they've no way home , and there's not a room in the city .	4
Darling , is that you ?	2
If we screw up graduation , we'll have to take basics all over again .	4
I was in front and you were behind with a gun in my back .	4
Why don't you stay where you belong , in yo - yo land ?	3
And see that you get out of town .	1
I could have finally gotten my yoga certification ... It wouldn't have been .	1, 6
Please don't spank me , Mr [PERSON] .	4, 5
To cover it up .	7
That's why you have to have faith . If it made sense , it wouldn't have to be a religion , would it ?	5
Is she crazy or what ?	1, 3, 7
A traitor !	1, 3
Hey , let's play With the mystic spirit board , ok ?	2, 5
Did I go too far ?	4
There's something very wrong here .	4
Have you no patriotism ?	3
I want to hear everything you've been doing .	2
I'll protect you .	8
We're just the guys to do it .	8
Young man , your self - righteous piety is commencing to annoy me .	3
Not much comfort .	6
You look pretty good up there yourself .	7
Not my book , anyway .	1
I hope I shall .	2
They are the tears of Old [LOCATION] .	6
Yeah , absolutely .	5
I'm not asking you , I'm telling you . You're in danger .	1, 4
We actually did recoveries of crashed saucers .	5
In the past we've had our differences but I'm sure they can be worked out .	8, 2
It's the blood , bone and sinew of this democracy that great men handed down to the human race !	1
We haven't anything to discuss with you .	1
Say , I understand those Mexican señoritas are still pretty as ever down there .	5
What's this bullshit ?	1
It is infernal !	1, 4, 7
Did you ask God to be with you and keep you strong ?	8
And if I kissed it ... and made a wish ... it'd come true .	2, 7
You want to play games ?	3
If you would've had four fours , you would've won .	6
What a cruel shame that any man is made to suffer so .	6
I want the Governor's residence , [LOCATION] .	2
Go dry yourself , [PERSON] .	1
A setup !	3
They're coming to get you , [PERSON] .	1
And I was with some boys in the neighborhood , and we saw this and went ,  Oh , My God ! 	7
Nobody could ever say different .	8, 5
Things will change .	8
Now tell me you're glad to see me .	5
I'm sorry I don't have one for you .	6
I can't sleep .	6
A day made for breakfast and reading the Sunday paper .	5
I'm happy to say the old bladder's working .	5
He forgets easy what that money cost me .	1, 3
Nice party .	5
Yes , she did . I speak to your secretary more than I speak to you .	3
[PERSON] , if you knew what I've gone through !	6
We will fire him into the eternal darkness as a testimony to our piety and godliness .	3
Was ?	7
On the way home we did loop - the - loops so that I could see the moon upside down .	5
It would make me happy to be a grandmother , [PERSON] .	2
Everybody likes ice cream .	5
Tonight we'll meet our contacts .	2
I'm going to take this directly to [PERSON] .	2, 5
A lost decade , but it was worth it to make your father pay for my loss .	1
You made a mistake I'm not [PERSON] !	4, 7
Vamos !	1, 2, 5
Two minutes more and we'll know if your idea was any good .	2
Our reputation wouldn't be worth a nickel .	4
You're a fine shot .	5
Check every floor .	8
I triangulated her cell .	5
Here , the kind of respects .	8
That's nice .	5
The State calls Detective [PERSON] .	2
But I thought we were gonna be partners .	6
This is how you do it ...	2
You can't afford this .	6, 7
Adalind went into labor .	5
Let's go .	2, 5
I was very sick when I was a boy .	6
I thought of you .	8, 5
Another dead end .	4
He begged [PERSON] to let him live and offered him his lance .  	4
Ostentatious , that is !	2, 5, 7
Do you have a gun ?	2
[PERSON] , are you ready ?	2
You know what would happen if [PERSON] found out ?	4
My son , to see you again causes my heart to soar like a hawk .	5
You have been making things terribly difficult for Colonel [PERSON] .	1
I can't believe this is you , [PERSON] .	7
When were you going to give the money to the community ?	1
Yeah , mind your own business .	1
He needs someone to underwrite the paper . Find out who .	2
He's of no use to no one , including himself .	1, 3
I want some flowers .	2
Hey , you know there was a guy in the game that accused me of juicing the deck ?	1, 7
I think you're all being unfair .	1
And ... a little looking out for the other fellow too .	8
With who ?	2
Well , you know , there wasn't much we could do .	6
Doesn't the prestige of the Bolsheviks mean anything to you ?	3
I hope I never wake up .	6
I wish I could believe that .	6
I don't owe you jack shit .	1
Grandfather , I think it's a good day to die .	6
Father [PERSON] told me that you had to keep your hands to yourself .	6, 7
We are so proud of you . Do you get a discount ?	5
What he did was , he just took my money .	6, 7
That smell of death .	4
Time could not mar the perfect symmetry of those walls .	5
Drop it , okay ?	1
What are you afraid of ?	8, 7
You a fifty - dollar whore ? - What are you doing ?	3
Should I just stand around and let that drooling infant wrap that [LOCATION] dam appropriation around my neck ?	3
You surprise me , Mr. [PERSON] .	7
What the hell is this ?	1
No case ? Your client put a faulty train on those tracks , people died , and they knew it could happen the whole time .	3
In this business , one should joke a little .	5
[PERSON] , I warn you .	4
Don't talk like that .	1
I got a surprise for you tonight .	2
And this spic , [PERSON] , what a fucking nut case .	1, 3, 7
Such vanity .	3
Shall I see you to your cabin ?	8
Or it's just [PERSON] that smells like street shit over there .	3
Bullshit !	1, 3
She could not have been with [PERSON] .	7
Better have something to give me this time , officer .	2, 3
What if we use the first letter of every word ?	2
They notified me .	1, 7
You're a crazy son of a bitch , [PERSON] , but we're with you .	8, 5
It turned out beautifully , didn't it ?	5
I wasn't anywhere near here !	1
Enjoy your stay in [LOCATION] .	2, 5
Three's hardly an army .	1, 3
What's the matter with you ? What happened ?	7
Did somebody say chase  ? 	2, 5
Whiskey .	5
They would be bugging your phone , surveilling you hours a day , and they wouldn't have tipped you by sending [PERSON] . I -	4
I must say he seems quite a reasonable type .	8
They'll be back in two or three days .	2
It doomed me forever to middle management , and that's the truth .	1, 6
Now , these legs are very nice .	5
Time's getting short .	2
As you can see , the available forces have been badly distributed .	1
Accept one of these cigars , professor .	2
Fuck only knows why [PERSON] lets them in .	1, 3
Can't he stay ? Tomorrow's not a school day .	6
You'll soon be in [LOCATION] now .	2
Just please help us .	4, 6
I didn't marry her under my real name .	7
And ten minutes later I got the call ... that the court had found in our favor .	5
[PERSON] ? I forgive you for failing .	8
You're not easy to talk to on the phone , so I decided to ambush you .	2
It's good , isn't it ?	5
She was the one ... who got you the passport to go to the [LOCATION] .	7
Oh , how lovely .	5
Look , I was never at [PERSON]'s house .	1
That's done it , he's gone .	1
How this could become part of the legacy of The Village Voice is depressing to me .	3
Please make yourselves at home	8
No ! You know what you're full of , [PERSON] ? Sin !	6, 7
Even collects stray boys and cats .	8
I am looking for blue jeans .	2
You're just being used , you know .	6
Pray you get the chance .	4
But I'm always going to be a killer .	1
Mr. [PERSON] knows perfectly well the witness is unable to answer that question .	6, 7
We're on a roll .	5
I'm against it .	1
It'll do that poor sore throat good .	8
The last time this witch went to a party , she made the princess prick her finger with a spindle and fall asleep for years .	1, 2
What the hell do you think that I do ?	1
Are you ready , boy ?	2
She was worried about you .	6
I hated to do anything that might get you into trouble .	6
Isn't she gorgeous ?	5
Who's dead ?	4
But they're all dead .	4
And now if ... When we get a cab we can complete the plan and live out our lives with a modicum of dignity .	8, 2, 5
He'll never get started .	6
Champion of dumb animals , ladies in distress , lost kids and lost causes .	3
Honey , it's nice to have somebody take care of you .	8
It's taken care of .	8, 5
But right now , I can't think of one .	7
Isn't technology wonderful ?	5
It gives me a terrible pain .	6
Well , if it's anyone's fault , I expect it's mine .	6
If men and nations had this goodness that I speak of , I would be willing to share all this ... My records , everything .	6
I will satisfy you .	8
How did I get such a smart - ass kid ?	3
Kirk , [PERSON] has made a chump out of you .	1, 3
Are we killers now ?	7
That's what always happens when people fall in love .	6
Noise , what's that noise ?	7
I never said monster .  	8, 2
Why not you ?	7
I require an answer .	1
Yes , we have all been there , haven't we .	8
And we need to engage astronomers and amateur astronomers , and set up a sighting situation where we show them some evidence , and then show them how it's debunked .	2
Looks like the coast is clear .	2, 5
You lost your ship ?	7
How about the movies ?	2
I just invited him to dinner .	2
So how can you tell the difference ?	7
You're out !	8, 1
I'm expecting a baby .	2
They all coldcocked me .	1, 6
I have known what it is like to be in love , to be married in a church to a man that I love ,	8, 5
I don't have any secrets .	8
They're unbelievable .	7
It's great , Meat , it's great .	5
That name's kinda familiar , ain't it , Mink ?	7
Bloody footsteps leading up to the door ?	4
Breaking my heart with your impossible love !	6
Elder , if you have something to say , just say it	1
It is almost frightening how much in love with you she is .	3, 7
I demand you stop this charade ! You ... Demand ?	1, 7
Come here for a second , please .	2
I was coming down the steps and there was the watchman lying dead at my feet .	4
They aren't moving .	1
I've got some good wine .	5
The Feds found the lake house !	4
I couldn't be certain your apartment was safe .	4
You're going into the arena alone .	1
Won't you tell us all about it ?	2
Oh ! Sorry . You made me jump .	7
You pulled them all off me , you stupid son of a bitch .	3
The part that really bothered me was the part where he indicated that ,	3
Quit your swearing , [PERSON] .	3
If I told you what we've been through ...	6
No use leaving all those repeating rifles lying out there to rust .	1
I'm pregnant , you know .	7
This is no time to play in the snow .	1, 6
The devil with him !	1
How did [PERSON] injure Liberty Rail ?	4
You and that winning personality of yours .	8, 5
Let me finish . Of course nobody will buy it if they know it's rat .	1
And , [PERSON] , I'm going to see that you are safe .	8
Because that challenge is one that we're willing to accept .	2
It's good for the soul .	5
Despised him .	3
I could have saved time and liquor by doing this in my office , but it needs a little ceremony .	2, 5
I'm just a bit dizzy . Can you stay with me for a bit ?	4
I have no intention of drowning with you .	1
He's not without experience , you know .	8
Did he in you ?	2, 3
I can't do any more after that .	6, 7
What is it , [PERSON] ?	4
Things started to pick up for the home team when [PERSON]'s brother , a ganef if ever I saw one , took the stand .	2
Ladies and gentlemen , the famous [PERSON] has gladly consented to sing a few songs for us tonight .	2
I'd love to hear how Junior's doing and , well , it would be fun being with you .	2
Anyway , false hope is better than none	2
Will you get that freaking nut job off my back ?	1
Want to trick me ?	2
Reluctantly , I may add .	1
Your address is inside the cover . Really ?	1, 2
The battleships , man !	2
I'm pretty sure I didn't kill anyone for it .	8
They behead people at noon	3, 4, 6
Now , those were your exact instructions , [PERSON] , so don't punish Oscar for it .	1
It's about time they brought them from the force into here , right ?	8
I assume you can prove that if necessary .	8
All right , I'll see him right away .	2
Could you use some help , Mr. [PERSON] ?	8
I know you like the way I feel .	5
Just kiss my ass from now on .	1
He said that to scare us .	3, 4
We need to warn [PERSON] and [PERSON] .	4
Well , I ain't scared .	1
You've fallen in love with him ? Did you kiss him ? On the mouth ?	5, 7
Our own Mayor [PERSON] .	8, 2
Maybe I can help you .	8
Sabotage , demolition , that line of country .	3
There's still places I want to see and things I want to do .	6
Toad's friends tried to help him , but were always blocked .	6
How do you know how to do all of this ?	7
Gentlemen , the philosophy is pure Zen and the method is pure science .	8
In case you need a quick getaway ? I know how you feel .	8
I'm sure [PERSON] would want you to stay .	8
I'll see you tomorrow .	8, 2, 5
Have you ever danced with anyone before ?	2
Her secret is that she's making half a million bucks a year and she still collects alimony from me , in my present reduced circumstances .	1, 3, 6
She would be pained to hear you say that .	6
He liked you .	5
I'm pleased to meet you , ugly wop son of a bitch .	3
Oh , know how to count !	1, 7
That's great .	2, 5
Yes sir , the thrill of the open road .	2, 5
He's really caving in . I want him to commit his stocks to us this afternoon .	2
Where did he go ?	2, 7
Tell everybody to go home .	1
Tell the King ... that try to forgive him .	2, 5
Once that secret mentions the visit of the president at a secret air base for the purpose of inspecting things from outer space .	3
I hate jumping out of a perfectly good airplane .	1
It must be a mistake , he was clever ...	6, 7
The epidermal what ? No !	1, 4
She's got many men in her life , and they take her to lots of different clubs .	5
You can afford it when I kick your teeth !	3
And then I - I don't know what happened .	6
When a threatening power lands in our capital we don't meet them with tea and cookies .	1
Don't you believe it .	7
Well , it can't be helped now .	6
It's also possible to look at this in , really , just a slightly different way , which is just as sad , maybe even sadder .	6
Can't you tell me what's happened ?	7
You and I could go there .	2
All stations ready . Prepare for diving .	2
Glad to see you .	5
He says that [LOCATION] will uphold it in every court ... but I will drag you through every court , don't forget that .	1
It's an insult .	3
He won't be bribed or threatened .	8
But the rescue has to happen immediately .	4
You drink to relax .	8
Not written on those drowned faces out there But on the faces of dead thousands !	4
What's that for ?	7
You better talk to her now .	1, 3
Inside there's a huge creature	2, 4
What are you talking about ?	1, 2, 4, 7
I don't expect nothing . I'm nonchalant .	8, 4
They seem so childish .	3
I'm an old man who will live until I die .	6
I'm waiting .	1
Just put me in your pocket and take me with you .	8
All those fighters you beat , you beat 'em with heart , not muscle .	8
How fortunate we are to have [PERSON] with us .	5
Why did they pull out ?	7
No , not tonight .	3
Then go find that guy with the arm .	2
Mac ...	7
I mean , about my having this floor to go on with my babbling .	6
You know what we ought to do ? Steal the money for ourselves .	7
I've been hiding it just for you .	8
Well , for god's sake , it's my account .	1
Then I wan na make a speech from the top of the hill .	2
Can you help me out with this crazy wiring on the socket ?	8
Blow it , [PERSON] !	1
Shortly after midnight as a surprise .	2
Drained their life savings , ruined hundreds of lives , and made off with over $ million .	1, 3
Child , crying :	6

Hey , buddy boy !	2, 5
Uh , make sure you bring it back .	8, 2
Get out of here before I throw you out .	1
Don't misunderstand me .	4
She looks like a jelly doughnut , doesn't she ?	3
I'm afraid it's all my fault .	6
I've got tons of exotic destinations , faraway places , custom designed for a romantic weekend getaway .	2, 5
Go tell your dad I need him .	2
My back's giving me hell .	6
Respond .	1
He has to testify again in [LOCATION] in days , but he not gonna make it now because by tomorrow this story's in the newspaper .	4
It was just so perfect I just had to catch it .	5
You got him hooked ?	2, 7
Those dirty bastards !	3
I know you want to get out of here , and so do I. We're going to do it .	8, 2
Say nothing .	1
Getting there by : would be terrific .	2
We must be extremely careful what goods we take in exchange .	4
People always do what you tell them to do ?	1
A whale can jump up like an earthquake and come down on you like a mountain that somehow put to sea .	4
Won't you change your mind and stay for dinner , Mr. [PERSON] ?	2
Don't you raise your voice to me !	1
No , you're perfectly right .	8
All right , next time I hear it , I am taking it away .	1
Take the day off .	2
Oh , it's swell !	5, 7
RJ and [PERSON] could move there , and he could be the mayor of [LOCATION] . Stop .	1, 3
I don't want you smoking in the car tomorrow .	1
Something about your mother .	7
That's enough of that .	1
I am an expert on this .	8
Well , there's something I've always wanted to ask . Will [PERSON] ever become president ?	2
All ?	7
What a comeback , [PERSON] ventura !	7
When he held me , it wasn't the way a father should hold a daughter .	6
And as long as you terrorize me , I'm gonna fight you .	3
Are you willing to fight , men ?	8
Meaning what ?	1
Oh Sugar ! That sounds like so much fun but Guess who's back together with your dad .	5
When I get home , I shall write a book about this place .	2
Where's the money ?	1
I can't believe anything you tell me now .	1
[PERSON]'s looking for a new assistant and wants to meet you for a drink .	2
We'll head into the wind .	2
I've never seen anything in my life as beautiful as you are .	5
I'm just tired .	1, 3, 6
I want to play the pain in [PERSON] .	2
All right , for those people on the street , if there's any trouble , collapse on the house . Those inside , stay inside .	4, 7
It could have been a dead end .	4
He's probably walking around here , lost .	6
Bringin' her home in the middle of the night wouldn't help anybody , especially her .	1
You belong with me .	8, 5
I'm gonna get me one of these .	2
Hello .	2
The spirit world , man .	8, 2
They'll destroy you .	4
He ain't God .	3
Next time you try that , I'll forget that you're a woman .	3
Cheese doodles !	2
Soon we will expand from city to city .	2
Oh , [PERSON] , can I have a chocolate one stuffed with meringue ?	2
Killed the pain all right , but he almost died .	4
I just want to learn my lessons and do my studies . So I can be smart and become a priest !	2
Will you be back for breakfast ?	2
How are you ? - I'm OK .	8
A little expensive , but lots of fun !	5
You know , it's a lot of legal rigmarole .	3
I hate to ask you this after you've been so helpful but could you do something for me tonight ?	8
We've been kicking ass for 200 , years !	5
We all have to sacrifice something .	6
All the poor young girls .	6
You go expecting these things to happen and they do .	7
Jeanne ... Majesty .	1, 3, 4
Doesn't look like there's any other damage .	5
If you hadn't promised so faithfully , I wouldn't have planned the whole thing .	1
What happens to us now ?	4
Miss , you can be quite sure that I shall report this to the proper authorities .	1
Come on , Dad .	2
He's keeping his promise to [PERSON] in his own way .	8

Wonderful , my dear fellow .	5
Love you .	8, 5
Pick you up in an hour .	2
He's honest .	8
You can give him a hug when we get home .	2
You think he's gonna say , I've had it  ? 	7
I'll be stuck here doing your work while you run all over the city fighting crime or something .	3
Let me tell you what I said when she was born .	8
He'll be a champ .	2, 5
I'll save you !	2
Your husband is harboring a killer .	3
That's terrible .	6
We should be there in about minutes .	2
I think it's best . If I don't see you guys anymore .	1
Will you be needing the car tonight ?	2
Oh , please send her in .	1, 7
Yes , yes ? Is it true that priests and nuns Have orgies in the [LOCATION] ?	2
You can not tolerate the faith in humanity , Because if you do , all this ... The structure of your very existence ,	6
What'll we do ?	4
I got it from the best authority .	8
Thanks very much .	8
I like your tailor .	5
[PERSON] presses hard on every case , [PERSON] .	8
That's my girl .	8, 5
Only if I deserve to be .	2, 6
Faster ? ! ...	4
Quickly !	2, 4, 7
If there's anything you want to say , I'll be glad to listen .	8
Why don't you both shut up ?	1
Well , now I'll tell you what I had on my mind .	2
What's that ...	4
You skip meetings I'm supposed to go to .	1
I'm paralysed with happiness !	5
Come on , son . Come on .	8, 4, 5
Where did she get a bag to match those shoes ?  	7
You are correct .	8
Those dopes are trying to crack open the safe .	3
That's one of the things I hope the formula will alleviate .	2
We weren't trying to escape .	4
Now , don't be a child .	3
That's what I do .	8, 5
If we're good nuns , God will see us through .	8
I didn't know you were a music aficionado .	7
This could look bad for OCP , [PERSON] .	4
Yes !	5
I thought they were with [PERSON] .	7
What are you doing ? All right , come on .	7
Tri Face !	7
It's not a role . It's a job , a rent - paying job . Now come on ;	2, 5
You two know each other ?	7
Why don't you come in and join ...	2
And as I was relating this to him , our missiles started shutting down one by one .	4
[PERSON] , what did I do ?	1
The police have road blocks on every main exit from town .	4
So , what happened after he climbed up the tower and rescued her ?	2
Our best hope lies in what you people can develop to help us .	8
These are strange times , my friend .	4
You've got a real twisted mind , haven't you ?	3
Terrific .	5
Listen , when you guys meet her , just try to make me look good .	2
I mean the commissioner and the mayor decided not to set a precedent inviting every maniac in this city to kidnap someone .	1
Even if it could be your involvement with drugs has vindicated me .	1, 3
Then , suddenly , I vomited on my family . Hmm .	7
I don't know , the words just slipped out .	7
Is her lover . He comes over .	5, 7
I was in that room !	1
This is the right path for you .	8
Sometime this year we'll take those guns to [LOCATION] and have them fitted properly .	2
Don't be long . You'll catch a cold .	4
Is this our new car ?	7
Yes , ma'am ?	8, 2
Slow down , we lost [PERSON] !	1, 4
Make it a single , [PERSON] .	8, 1, 2
Well , I really put my foot in my mouth this time but , I don't know , I like you two .	8, 3, 5
You tell us you're a doctor , you rogue ?	3
I wanted to let you know that the ambulance was late in getting away .	6
No need to shove !	3
The drinking , the drugs , that's not a regular thing for me .	6, 7
It's something I couldn't discuss with anyone .	4
Now where the hell am I ?	1, 4
[PERSON] . We missed you , buddy .	8, 5
What about us ?	4
Oh , well , that's a splendid idea , Mrs. [PERSON] .	5
Don't change the station .	1, 2
I'm telling you , it's gonna be all right .	8, 5
Just what we been waitin' for .	5
[PERSON] , sir , Operations .	8, 4
It's blackmail , pure and simple .	3
And we are going to get drunk , Cross .	2
What's the fish's name again ?	2
Yes , I'm talking about honour , not ideology .	1
And that , that caused me to do the most dumb - ass thing I've ever done in my life .	3, 6
Isn't it possible that some sort of external intelligence , some discarnate entity , has crossed into our plane of existence ?	4
I know you are .	8
You're a disgrace to your country !	3
All right , let's go back to [LOCATION] and make this movie .	2
Doctor's here to examine you , freak just so no one can say we laid one finger on you .	1
There's this sudden thrill , like ... while the person you love is inhabiting the same world as you .	8, 2, 5
Looks like we're going that way .	7
[PERSON] , we've got to talk first .	2
I suggest that we do .	2
How about two foursomes of golf , huh ?	2
This nice man's taking you to your aunt .	8
Well , I'm happy , anyway .	5
I know , [PERSON] , but ...	6, 7
I'm happy to see you .	5
The Navy's waiting for me to make a mistake , but I won't make it .	2, 4
Excellent . I don't know about the rest of you , but I'm hungry .	2, 5
Whaddya trying ' to do , make it a short day ?	1
Turn 'em off !	1
Mind keeping that door closed , please ?	1
How did you pull that ? What do you got ...	7
I think it's cute .	5
Are they gonna get in ?	4
How'd you like to spend the rest of your life with Shooter ?	2
Because I want to .	8, 1, 2, 3
Then there were some who just got tired of living .	6
You know what ? It doesn't even matter . Because I'm taking over .	1, 3
We were worried about [PERSON] .	4
I am so sorry . Hi , buddy !	8, 4
What if we had dinner ? I give up .	8, 2
I'm a fighter .	8
They're okay .	5
Maybe you'll buy me a couple of drinks .	2
New places , new people and new sites of interest .	2, 5
Take care !	5
What can I get for you ?	2
Don't be hard on yourself .	8, 5, 6
You hiding him , boy ?	7
Uh , I'm father mayii . I called ...	4
I'll put money in his bank anytime .	8
Puts the bag in the basement freezer ... And waits .	2, 3
They will believe you .	8
Holy shit .	7
What was I supposed to think when you didn't come home ?	1, 4
To begin with , a thief .	3
I'd only mess that up too .	6
And the last time you were in my office , you told me you hadn't committed a crime to get the job done .	1
[PERSON] , give me the nails over there !	1, 2
I wish you'd tell Marigold to shut her silly old face .	3
Thanks for the recap .	2, 5
Let's try it again . ♪ There was old man Nemo ♪	5
Why not throw some empathy my way ?	3
Of course she know them perfectly .	8, 2, 3
No more tears .	8
I'm taking him out to see monuments .	2
Nice and hot , just like you love it .	5
All right , [LOCATION] , that's enough .	1
Watch your manners .	3
This is only just for it is they who betrayed you by surrender .	3
Life , every now and then , behaves as if it had seen too many bad movies .	3, 6
What are you ?	2
Your mother was my dearest friend .	8
The present danger is ended .	8
You ain't really gonna let them take that baby , are you ?	4
Is there something I can do for you , ma'am ?	8
We'll make the deal .	8
I do not like Mr. [PERSON] .	1
I killed her .	6
Let's have a word , sugar puss .	2
Honey , we don't like nothing soft .	1
Fantastic !	5
I'll try , but she's in danger , [PERSON] .	4
I took some funds from the con - amalgate account , I. . . To cover a loan . I. . .	4, 6
Fear not .	8
So , did you watch I Spy last night ?	2
You [PERSON] ?	2
Why is Willy coming here ?	7
There was much to occupy me , So I left my apprentice to deal with [PERSON] .	8
The creatures were about uh , four foot .	7
Pretend the guy's like a balloon .  	2
Let me taste it .	2
Why am I here ?	7
He was killed .	4
We'll make it if we're careful .	8, 2
Are you blind ?	1
What do you mean ?	2, 4, 7
Good evening , lieutenant .	5
The fish that got away is always the biggest one .	6
I'm just a little anxious to get up there and whoop ET's ass , that's all .	2, 4, 5
You are right .	8
Well , if there's one thing I know , it's how to wear the proper clothes .	5
Or we have a problem with the judges .	4
Then I'll take her a petticoat .	2
My dad had the right idea .	8
I want to get something out of life .	1
The guy starts talking shit , so my brother picks one of them up . Shoots him right in the face .	8, 1, 3
Who in the world can do that ?	1, 7
I am not be fool . I am asking it to give me the honor of being my woman .	2
He can't be there !	1
I'd like to go home .	1, 2
That must have been very nice .	5
You need sort of a. . .	2, 5
What is it you want ?	1
There's a village back there , and you know they got some girls there that would just --	2
Is it important ?	2
We're running out of ammunition .	4
There's no happiness like it .	5
And that's exactly what I'm going to do .	8
What you think ?	2
There's my favourite little boy .	8, 5
He's wonderful .	5
That's the way it's been your whole life .	6
You said you could supply weapons ?	2
Aw , [PERSON] , now what ?	3
Keep the line straight !	1
You'd better take this extra $ .	8
I made a special effort to not look like a nurse .	2, 7
The general talked about killing the president .	3, 4, 7
Maybe she even killed my partner , [PERSON] .	1, 3
That's what I pay you for .	1, 5
Four minutes to bomb time .	4
I could never do anything like that .	6
No , no , no . lt's Saturday night , man .	3, 6
I think it's safe .	8
What do you have ? What are you hiding ?	6, 7
Where'd you get that ?	2
Sir , I don't care about the blame . I care about the safety of my team and I care about getting those Stingers back .	1, 2
I'll give you one more chance .	8
It's not your fault the plane landed in [LOCATION] .	6
Well , it figured . It was like that from the minute I laid eyes on her .	8, 5
Why did you get married ?	7
While you try to steal my money the union accepts an offer from [PERSON] .	1
Fuck you , [PERSON] .	1
Because she can't stand him !	1
Kill him !	1
Miss [PERSON] , I have discovered how to retard the ageing process .	5
Maybe this war is necessary .	8
Ask him !	1
Without the ring , there will be no sacrifice , without the sacrifice , no congregation .	8
We'll go tomorrow .	2
Then the [PERSON] and everybody in it could be destroyed .	4
I don't know you get to ask that .	1, 3
You're still an idiot .	3
Fuck it !	1
All I'm askin' for is a chance .	8, 2, 6
When I wake up I tell them what I dreamt .	2
I'm trapped .	4
Sometimes it's worse to stay than it is to run .	6
I could ask you the same question .	1, 2
I'll figure it out .	8, 2
I'll give it to you , [PERSON] .	8
Better make it tomorrow .	2
What difference would it make ?	6
Dopehead mothers . Garbage blood .	3
Even if you get past me , there are cops waiting outside .	8, 4
That seems to me like a darn short prayer for a sinner like Dude .	3
Right this way .	2
Some poor son of a bitch on a public - indecency charge ... Paid off a PA to have his case dismissed .	1
We need to find both of them before they try to pay that ransom .	4
I can't go through it ... You hear me ?	4, 6, 7
You'd best come home with me .	8
Could I get some extra mayo ?	2
I want to go .	4, 6
In the ring , it's like all I see is him .	2
Play fair with me , fat man .	3
I thought we had an understanding .	1, 6
There's nothing to be afraid of .	8
The choice is yours .	8
See , that didn't hurt .	5
I'm not hearing this .	1
I don't know what a Snap Dog is .	1
There's no time !	4
Back in the village when they made fun of you , I wanted to kill them .	1
I want to bring the same truth to this role that I brought to Guppy the newsboy in Hey , Hey , It's Guppy !	2
I've lied and used people all my life because I thought everybody did .	6
Run away now or I'll kick you .	1
We were just talking .	6
Well , if there's been a mistake , it's yours .	1, 6
Hey , let me outta here !	4
I am not powerful enough	6
gonna be held as sheriff , if they elect me .	2
I don't think a lot of us stopped and thought , This could be our sister or our brother .  	3, 6
Well , I don't think I can do much , sir , but ...	6, 7
Come on , let's sing .	2
Now , they were mostly destroyed , but I was able to recover data from one of them .	2, 5, 7
I'm gonna give you something to remember me by .	8, 5
And that's the only way to make change , is to make your voice known .	8, 4
Then they'll meet with you .	2, 5
You can't do this ...	1
There is no room in this regiment for a coward .	3
How's is that , folks ?	8, 5
I always said the Union National was a phoney bank .	3
We ... we have a few more questions to ask .	4
You earned a piece of it .	8
Imagine , an important part of my life wasted between whistles .	6
Let's begin with the letter .	2
Fuck off .	1
To do that would cause worldwide panic .	4
Yeah , I sure feel sorry for you , [LOCATION] .	6
I wish I could share your confidence .	6
Your hands are sunburned , aren't they ?	7
We've been waiting ...	2
I'm fucking great .	8, 2, 5, 7
Then you thought up this idea .	5
I must not get too close to women	6
Will you be putting up a new sign ?	2
Word for word one of the best lies I've ever told .	5
Pleased to meet you .	8, 2, 5
Save us digging new ones .	8, 5
[PERSON] , I'm going to let you in on something .	8
But when I'm lining up a deal , I don't want any dancehall woman listening in !	3
You must know how important that is to us .	4
No , [PERSON] ! Don't !	4
[PERSON]'d be so disappointed if you weren't surprised .	6
How do you smell so good in a hospital ?	5, 7
One that will scream in the middle of the night and you'll have to stumble downstairs in the dark and change his soiled diapers .	3, 6
I was lucky enough to be a guest .	5
Wait till they get a load of me .	1, 2
Hey ! Guess what ?	2, 5
She's an angel .	8, 5
Then if you ain't my pa , I want my $ 200 !	1
Yeah , I'm gonna feed her .	8, 2
Oh yeah . I had been knocked out in the pub after a shotgun to the head .	1, 7
Don't !	1, 4
Don't need anybody right now .	1
His place ? You've walked into his places all unsuspecting many , many times .	2
They're a physical bunch . They're macho , body - proud .	3
I haven't been , uh , entirely honest With you , and , uh ...	4
God , this is a list of questions that could unlock all the Sov military secrets and win the arms race at a stroke :	7
What do you want to see tonight ?	2, 5
We also escaped with the million pounds of somebody else's money .	1
Wherever did you find her ?	7
An odd coincidence , both of you turning up here .	7
Stay in the car , they'll tear you apart .	4
I know I'm being disrespectful to this honourable body ...	6
Hey , Captain . Captain , we left a treasure out there ...	7
But , sir , when the job's done , who knows if we can return by this route or whether we could find you if we did ?	4
Get the legs .	1, 2
I don't know why I'm in such a hurry to get into trouble again .	4
You don't even know him !	7
So , you're just going to let this woman blackmail you without a fight ?	1, 3
We're not on the same side .	1
He's making his big move .	2, 5
These terrorist attacks are aimed at you .	4
Goddamn it , [PERSON] , will you trust me ?	1
You're gonna get the shakes soon , [PERSON] .	4
I'm gonna say , this is a crucial moment . For both of you .	2
That's very nice .	5
I will not be one mind with you !	1
Still eating ?	3
Fine !	1
The helicopter crashed .	4, 6
The whole world sucks .	3, 6
There's no cause for temper , child .	1
Why do you hate everybody ?	8, 1, 6, 7
Hey , sugar , you looking for a date ?	2
If he can't find enough facts to break you with , I'll give him a couple .	3
Think fast .	2
You did . You killed your wife . You killed benham .	1, 3
Who , in your high school , has become homosexual or is deep into drugs ?	3
You can do it .	8, 5
Leon , why are you so good to us ?	7
And what will you do then , [PERSON] ?	1
Cut the shit .	1, 3
[PERSON] said she couldn't go out tonight , so I said she could use the parlour .	8
I must reply his kindness someday	8
It's nice , isn't it ?	5
When that light hits the water , this boat will be compromised .	4
The tow place ? - Yeah . Great .	8
Yes , I think I do .	5
It's terrible that bad things happen , and all we do is stand by and watch .	6
If you see her , hang on to her .	8
I think I could turn and live with animals .	3
You'll see that I get away all right , see that I get to a doc ?	8
I told you I didn't want any calls .	1
What happened ? Where are the others ?	7
He thinks I may be arrested any minute .	4
I've , uh , really enjoyed this little chat .	4
They can not be here , so we ask you to consider them in your decision .	8
As in ... pointless .	1, 3, 4
I'm happy to get out of this madhouse .	5
No ! By God , you may not !	1, 2
People out there are looting the streets , robbing off hard earners , hard grafters .	3
You give us a fair shake , we'll give you a fair shake .	8
I mean , he makes a very fine officer .	8
He owns Wolf City Development , which owns [LOCATION] ... which lets us alone .	8
Qualified ?	7
They haven't even been touched !	7
Oh , this place is such a mess .	3
How many ? = All of us . - Sorry , not enough room .	4, 7
You stool for him , fuck .	1, 3
It pretends this man is in danger when no one cares about him one bit .	1
Complete reversal of usual behaviour pattern .	7
By having all the secrecy and refusing to set up any kind of diplomatic protocols as I know that you have called for and I believe in very strongly .	6
How did you know I was here ?	7
Oh , but I can't intrude .	6
They're from the guy who pumped my stomach . Bullshit .	1
So , I can not imagine , my dear [PERSON] , why you should wish to involve yourself .	7
Old man , how long have your been here ?	7
If we didn't have a price on our heads , we'd get out of this hole .	4
There's hope that we'll both survive .	5
Never has deposited it . Like I say , he's a nut .	3
You , too , think I am too old , too ugly for a man to look upon with love .	6
You preached about faith and other rubbish .	3
Don't you doubt Miss [PERSON]'s word !	1
This is war !	1
What the fuck are you on about ?	1
Oh , God , no . Oh , no .	4, 6
We have a lot of good connections in [LOCATION] .	5
Wow ... you look great .	8, 5, 7
Mr [PERSON] , there's someone I'd like you to meet .	2
Oh , did I ? Uh , I am .	7
Don't exaggerate .	1
What's the matter ?	2, 4, 6
It's safe , trust me .	8
What if you have to back to the castle ?	4
You know this guy ? - Yeah .	7

For me ?	2, 7
You know , you remind me more and more of my first husband .	1, 3, 5, 7
It's been swell .	5
So , one day , it was my turn and I was just so determined that I was ... gonna show her I could be just as good as she could .	2
You're gonna be fine .	8, 2, 5
Your word to a breechclouted savage ?	3

Let's drink to something .	2, 5
You are a coward like all other people , aren't you ?	3
You know what I'll do in the morning ?	2
Soon you'll even forget that your last name is Chow	1
Or was I the man of the future ?	7
My dear child , there are many good books in this world without pictures .	5
Cease fire !	1, 2
That is a very deep cut .	4
Good evening .	5
I am a clown , and puzzled only by his presence in a place such as this , among such people as us .	7
What do you need money for ?	7

He looks like a drunk .	3
This is better , it's made out of real cotton .	5
He isn't half the father you were .	8, 3
You never wore that before .	7
I used to be popular , wasn't I , [PERSON] ?	6
Some detail I missed you might need to tell me .	2
Who's probably taking the day off again ?	7
That's the kind of stuff I like .	5
These assholes have been after me for my sources and you're ...	3
I must be honest with you .	8
It's a glitch in your system .	7
That's strange , my brother can't drive like that .	7
Shalakazam .	8

Please , let's go !	4
Hop on .	2
In a week , I can sell them anything .	2
They'll get her out for you .	8
How can you have the gall to compare the conflict here in [LOCATION] with a glass of cappuccino coffee ?	3
Now , my news .	2
Don't you think she's paid her dues ?	8, 6
So warm , so smooth .	5
There sure is gonna be some interesting people at that party .	2
I have something inevitable to tell you .	4, 6
This isn't my usual route .	2, 7
When an hour alone with you was an impossibility .	6
I know I can win the captain's confidence , But I need time and I need your help .	8, 2
No , I would ... I would remember something like that .	6
Diamonds in your hair , rubies on your fingers .	5
I don't care , it's not mine .	8, 2
Just apply a pint to your body and you're good for hours .	2
I wanted to stop you from doing something you'd be sorry for .	4
This morning this place was filled with books , wall to wall !	7

I want to feel my bones burst into a billion pieces !	2
I'll make you a deal .	8
Miss [PERSON] is going with you ?	7

I'm just asking about you , this person I'm sitting with .	8, 2, 5
[PERSON] -[PERSON] , how do you do ?	7
This way , [PERSON] .	2

My very best friends .	8
There's a lot too much going on .	1, 6
Your mom's having a stroke or menopause or something .	3
What did you do ?	2
You've caused enough trouble .	1
For four years , and now it's over . For four years , I've invited the guests and bought the favors and provided the entertainment and cleaned up the dirt and paid off the waiters and paid off the cops and paid off the papers and paid off the guests .	3, 6
How'd you boys know where to find me ?	7
A Webley automatic ...	7
But if it isn't me , then we have to make a deal , you and I , to accept that fact and find a way to stop it , OK ?	8
Don't start , [PERSON] .	1
You want some ? I won't tell anybody .	2

But the man I'm in love with doesn't .	6
Let's keep our eyes peeled for camp site .	2

I'm not concerned to hear your reasons , man .	1
He's a tortured , bitterly neurotic man who's finishing life on his own terms .	1
I've been to that scumbag town .	3
Sure , go ahead .	8
Besides ... , I don't want us to get too involved .	4
Elder , let's go in Elder ! Thrust out our chests	2, 5
Hope that some help comes .	4
I'll be late for the first bell !	4
He'd kill us if he got the chance .	4
[PERSON] , please !	1, 6
It's kind of the hardest part of all these 'cause he doesn't -- He don't know why we're here .	4
But what I tell [PERSON] to do , she will do .	8, 1
He's really nice .	8
Life can be infernally complex .	4
No , [PERSON] likes vulgar women .	3
My lawyer will get all this information , along with a doctor's report about my stomach and her ankle .	1
There is no other way out , my friend .	4

Oh , God .	4
You must be confused , senor .	1, 2

This kid's cryin' , man .	6
You got a weird family .	8
But you are more stupid .	5
Now that we've found each other again , I hope I shall see something of you .	2
He never spoke .	3
He was kind and thoughtful and happy about my success .	5
I'm impressed . Go ahead , detective sergeant .	8, 5, 7
Do you mean he'd never seen a clock before ?	7
That kind of love isn't enough for two people as different as we are .	6
Coochie ...	1
I live only for revenge .	1
You have to be a pig !	3
Don't be sure .	1, 3
It's utterly beautiful .	5
You then can have agriculture and manufacturing locally that has very little cost to it .	5
You can't leave me here alone .	7
Junior's gonna be a convict before he's in third grade !	3, 4
Attention on deck .	2
I'm afraid .	4
Come and fetch me , chéri ...	2
I always think candlelight's so romantic .	5
There's one on the back , but it's not the right one .	6
Let me decide what to do with it .	1
Every word that boy said about [PERSON] and me and graft and the rotten political corruption of my state is true !	8
Tough shit !	1
It's a good thing I'm in music instead of comedy .	5
Oh , there we go . Look at that .	7
He don't know the streets .	1
You want me to talk with the Federal Bureau of Narcotics see if they have any problems ? Internal Revenue Service ?	3

You told [PERSON] ?	1
I've missed so much !	6
Sleep well .	8, 5
Out in the country that , uh ...	4
You go round there and say you're sorry .	3
I got up and started to speak and the long powerful arm of [PERSON] reached into this sacred chamber and grabbed me by the neck .	4
If it were our plane , it'd be crashing .	1
It's impolite to stare .	3
You mean in the morning ?	7
We should leave before it's too late .	4
My brother seems to have forgotten his courtliness .	3
The woman that let her in swears your secretary told her she was with the National Transportation Safety Board .	7
I wish it made me feel good too .	6
It'd be a big help if you could keep an area clear in front of the bridge for us .	8
How much farther is it , Mr O'[PERSON] ?	2
Brilliant , brother , brilliant .	5
[PERSON] , could we have two seconds alone ?	8, 2
But the magic was just draining out of him every time he got on that commuter train , back and forth from the suburbs every day .	2, 5, 6
Bibbidi ... Bobbidi ... Boo .	5
You should've been there , [PERSON] .	1, 6
It's been ... a rewarding experience to watch a great artist at work .	8, 5, 7
With lunch !	5
And congratulations . I heard you're going to replace Mr. [PERSON] .	2, 5
One of these days , when I get my boat built I'm gonna drift out of this damn territory .	1
[PERSON]'s dead .	6
What on earth have they been doing to you ?	7
( Coughing ) Do you know you're out of your mind ?	8, 4, 7
So , if you folla us again , I chop your arms off , OK ?	1
You're [PERSON] ? !	7
I don't think we want to talk any more .	1
Well , I'm sure things must have been difficult with your parents passing .	6
You're the most beautiful person I ever met .	5
We want it now .	2
Ning !	5, 7
Miss Windy , the villa has been ransacked	4
I can smoke you out of there easy .	1
You should rest .	8, 5
I learned it from you , [PERSON] .	8
Are you trying to kill me ?	4
This is real nice .	5
What else could I do ?	1
Let's try it again . Oh , come on .	1
I think that about covers it for now .	5
My name is [PERSON] .	5
I do not think you quite realise my position .	1
Without you , [PERSON] .	6
Don't do it haphazardly This spell is hard to reverse	4
I'm always hiding from him , but he finds me .	1
You kids play baseball ?	2, 7
Yes , all right , I will call you later .	2
Busted .	1, 4
That's dangerous .	4
The Voice played a role in [LOCATION] [LOCATION]'s journalism that was unequaled .	5
[PERSON] , get real !	8, 5
Keep your head down , hotshot !	1, 4
He bought it the day following his appointment to the Senate and is using his privileged office for his own personal profit !	3
Now , [PERSON] , what time do we meet tonight , huh ?	2
What can you do ?	3
Anything serious ?	4
No , it was never love .	6
In the last century , the islanders were starving .	6
Elder , what should we do now ?	8
It's a big nut to crack .	2
I have to work .	6
You understand what that would mean .	8
Gee , I've never been to the circus before .	2
I sure couldn't tell you .	8, 3
What is wrong with you ? Come on !	1, 3, 7
All right , you take care .	8, 5
Then I got pretty tired of you and your pianos .	1
I've written it for you .	8
That's a lie !	3
Does it have anything to do with this amulet ? Yes ? !	2
And you look lovely in the candlelight .	5
Seeing you , [PERSON] .	8
You don't sound very grateful , Dr. Blood .	6
Well , you never even asked me why I was going .	1
Let's have some fun .	2
You should have a kid , [PERSON] .	5
It's too bad .	3, 6
What do you want to see me about ?	4
Stop yelling .	1
Come closer .	4
Unless he's looking for something else .	7
Erm ... I was just coming to that .	3
This is our compartment , not your compartment . I would like you to leave .	1, 3
And not for Mr [PERSON] , love him as I may .	3
Did you not once direct [PERSON] and [PERSON] ?	2, 7
Shoot and you'll hang for murder .	1
You done real fine .	5
Here , take a look at this .	2
It's disrespectful .	3
You took the bread out of half the mouths of [LOCATION] .	1, 3, 4
Ladies , stay down .	1
If by the third count you and your officers are not on the way to work I will give the order to fire .	1
It's all coming apart , Al.	4, 6
We have lots of little problems like this .	3
They hurt you any , [PERSON] ?	4
I set up a lunch for you at The [PERSON] .	2
What are they fighting about ?	1
I don't mind saying that I was scared because [PERSON] is known as a shooter .	8
It's the best .	5
A legend on this force is dead .	6
That don't do us any good .	1
[PERSON] ? Put that gun down .	4
Silence , [PERSON] !	1
You okay ?	2, 4
I wanted to surprise you .	2
He wants to get you and me in the ring .	8
♪ A whale of a tale , and it's all true ♪	5
The boat is gone .	6
All you have to do is be our pal .	8
That meteor is either very light , which is unheard of , or it's hollow .	7
It'll make you feel better .	8
Which is fine , because you really never could have had me anyway .	5
From my heart , I thank you .	8
Did you hope to go unnoticed here ?	1
And make some primo dinner reservations at [LOCATION] . For o'clock .	8, 2, 5
We were answering ad after ad , after ad , and we were finding that every case , every one was , in fact , someone who was prostituting themselves , someone who was being trafficked .	1, 3
[PERSON] , they'll kill you too .	4
gonna be some hard times coming down .	6
He's trying to help .	8
[PERSON] , what's the matter ?	4
My life is in your hands .	4
Why don't I drive up to this place with you and check it out ?	2
Thank God you're all right .	2, 4, 5, 7
You're doing great .	5
And don't forget , there are two things that have no limit :	2
How are you guys ?	1
How long before we'll know ?	2
Now I know how a poor little guinea pig must feel .	6
She's all right .	8
Now let's move , but let's take the back door .	2, 4
But it was worth it .	5
That seems a pity .	6
And I hate these fucking doughnuts .	1, 3
And you can't make me .	1
He's put his neck on the chopping block .	1, 4, 6
Cross , man , it's gonna cost you .	1
I told you I'd handle him .	1
Oh God , what a mess .	1
I don't care how you do it , but you find that desert rat .	3
I don't need entertaining .	1
Then if you did get me well and I went to him , you wouldn't like it .	6
My dear , I've never denied you anything that was in my power to give .	8
What are you doing ? - Shh .	4
Take me out . Help me !	4
He got run over by a car .	6
No , it's not .	1
May I say , my dear Colonel , that it's good to breathe the air of the Gestapo again .	5
If anyone looks like they know you ...	4
Let me show you to your new house .	8
Something hit us .	4
We'll take care of him , sir .	8

Every time I run into you , you tell me whatever shady thing just went down was about the greater good or that it didn't happen , or this , that , or the other .	1
Just give me a sign .	8, 2
You also know the usual French prison is filled with the relatives of all those poor little beetles you've killed .	3

But no , you had to be your stupid , stubborn , son of a bitch self .	1, 3
He's a little bit grumpy right now .	6
She was precocious , nosy , opinionated .	3
What's the great rush ?	7
There isn't anybody I can call for help .	4
Oh , it's your fault she's gone June ,	1, 3, 6
And you also have to cross-modify your judgment that the entire universe was created just as the stage upon which the drama of the human development is unfolding .	1
Right in the middle of our celebration ... the firebase got hit by a mortar attack .	4
Can't be good for the image .	4

He's so damn mean , he can't get along with anybody .	3
I think you're stupid .	1, 3
Poor country ! You sold the [LOCATION] in a senseless war .	6
Who do you think you're talking to . Shut up and go back to work .	1

Your miserable life is not worth a reversal of a Custer decision .	3
And they won't let you get away with this .	2
Comes up smelling ' like a rose every time .	5
But everyone pretended he could walk ?	7

It's time you woke up to your responsibilities .	3
He knew my father very well .	8
I'm sure you don't mean that .	6
I'm still in my office , I'll wait for you .	2, 5
He could speak out on environmental issues .	2

Good old Swayback .	8
You know , [PERSON] , you're the only one on this barge That understands me .	8, 5
That's part of the picture .	8
And you must be Mr Barley .	8
There's nothing wrong with that I hope , sister ?	4
Even before [PERSON] you refuse to reveal your true appearance !	3
And then he says , l sure hope he was guilty .  Then he laughs . 	1, 3, 7
I don't want to die !	4, 6
Never mind that rubbish .	3
You will live to regret this day .	1, 3
You may be right .	8, 2, 4, 6
You took money from me when I was playing , when I was winning .	1
You look so pretty .	5
That could take years ... cost millions of lives .	4
This dying sticks in my mind and makes me poor company .	6

Isn't it wonderful ?	5
If it's new committee assignments you'd like , we can certainly arrange that .	2, 5
We don't understand .	6
But for now , there is sufficient cowardice , sloth and mendacity down there on Earth to last forever .	3

He talks about the great lie  . 	6

And with your help ...	8
This is the captain speaking .	4
I wouldn't give two cents for all your fancy rules if behind them they didn't have plain , ordinary everyday kindness .	1
You mean , Dad's not coming home anymore ?	6
So much you had to take up with that low - down piece , old [LOCATION] .	3
I know you will .	2
What's the matter with my policy ?	7
I've seen him !	7
So that's what those things are for .	7

Company's coming .	2
Now's your chance , go !	7
We're begging .	4

All set .	2
I could sure use your help .	8
I'm with [PERSON] . You're on speaker .	8

What else ?	2
You've cost me millions and millions of francs .	1, 3, 6
Let's straighten up and fly right .	8
It's OK , I was thinking the same thing .	8
There and then before the gods , you made a pact only death could break .	8
I'll tell you something I read once , [PERSON] .	2
We've been through a lot together , and I don't want to see you do something , you know , without me if you really need me .	8
Oh , come on . It just would have been some cushy white - collar resort .	6

Wait till somebody gets killed ?	1, 3, 4, 6, 7
And I don't want to go to Hotel Terminus .	6
He did something wonderful .	8, 5
I'll pay both of you .	8

I'm sitting on something . I've got to say it to your face , Counselor .	8
I taught him .	8
I told you , you're probably overworking yourself .	6
I was holding her in my arms ...	4, 6
That's a good sign .	2, 5
I guess she doesn't have nowhere else to go .	6
You have a first name , haven't you ?	1
This is [PERSON] reporting live ...	2
I didn't know anything about this .	6, 7
How you going to stop me ?	1
This is not civilized !	1
She's getting outta range !	7
All she do is waggle her hips and shake her behind .	3
Shut up or you're dead !	1
No , no thanks .	1
Too little , too late .	6
Some people never learn .	1
You can't let radarjockeys push you around . Leave it to me .	1
Am I good with that statement ? I marked it up .	8, 5, 7
Let's go see the bearded lady .	5
In your case , I wanted to test your loyalty to your companions .	8
My best landing yet .	5
Is that all ?	2
I might be able to accommodate you .	8
You threatened her if she told me .	1
[PERSON] , my man .	5, 7
What the fuck are you doing in my office ?	1, 4, 7
A true Commander - in - Chief .	8
We've got six minutes before the brain's useless .	2, 4
Everybody trusts the FBI .	8
At first I was like , Why did I run away ?  	7
And we will be very , very happy and very , very rich .	5
[PERSON] , since you're not going on the cruise , I could use you at the store on Monday .	8
I got troubles of my own .	1
I am exactly three inches high and it is a very good height indeed !	5
First we steal his gun , then we shoot .	1
I'm not talking about him .	1
Big - hearted guy .	8, 5
Now they got of that Englishman's goons , and more are coming !	2, 3, 4
I thought they said they was from [LOCATION] .	7
I hardly number pirates among my acquaintances .	3
Coming !	2
But you are absolutely sure he was a priest ?	7
The ship's packed with Muslim pilgrims , which could present a hostage situation .	4
Is it true the ballet's moving out ?	7
Give me a nice big hug , like you used to when you were little .	5
Good boy .	8, 5
In two years time , he's gonna make a run for it .	8
Six days of this and I'll make you a hero .	8
So you're behind all this .	7
Then you have to talk to him before tomorrow night .	2
For the safety of the ship I obeyed Mr [PERSON]'s order . -	8
We've lost the baby's heartbeat .	6
Stop the car !	4
I've only got hours .	4
Really .	7
No way [PERSON] is going to talk me into cutting celery again .	1
Look how stupid you're acting .	3
So he's doing pretty good . I'm sure you can see that , though .	8
Room service , good morning .	5
Oh tots , I'll keep that in mind .	1, 7
Well ... L - l - listen ! Don't say anything to [PERSON] about this , all right ?	4
A good - looking girl like you ?	7
Tell me the truth .	8
You go home . I'll handle the captain .	8
I can't tell you that !	1
cause if you take two big bites and just swallow it , It could get stuck in your throat .	1
My courage almost failed me at the thought of meeting Ajax .	4
I promise I'll take care of the Grimm .	8
This is your problem .	1
Please . Understand I was taken by surprise .	8, 4, 6
All the good in this world came from fools with faith like that .	6
You people can either help me , or stay the hell out of my way .	1
Wow .	8
We , uh , have several people in mind .	4, 7
You won't tell anyone you saw me in there , will you ?	8
The perps are still on the train , okay ?	4
Because you talked me into this , that's why , you idiot !	3
What a great dress .	5
I have heard that is a great swordsman .	2
I hardly consider it fortunate to be bought by anyone by the name of [PERSON] .	3
Get rid of her .	1
And that scares the shit out of me , kid .	4
Are you going to come or do I have to drag you ?	1
The Cold War is over , Mrs. Acting President .	2, 5
That's just my nature .	6
That right , mister ?	1
You haven't bothered to find out ?	1
You're not the man your father was , [PERSON] .	3, 6
Unfortunately he has a habit of wasting taxpayers ' money .	3
Don't you have any principles ?	3
He's a gutless wonder .	3
I'm sorry . Do you mind getting the door , please ?	8
I can see the exit .	5
You want me to hang on to our cash .	8
Strange men , you mean ?	7
Every spring , the toilets explode .	3
We're not gonna hurt you .	8
It was nice of your mother to let you come .	5
They just have felonies .	3
And for that , I can never forgive myself .	6
We mustn't forget we wasted a month through an unfortunate disagreement for which I was not to blame .	3
They took [PERSON]'s body ? He can't even bury her ?	7
lt's good you told me . lt's very brave .	5
[PERSON] , she's dead .	8, 6
Holy smoke .	8
And this smog doesn't help anyway .	3
He might even be expecting you .	2, 4, 7
I said part of me  . 	1
And [PERSON]'s sent you about a ton of tea . Well , a couple of pounds .	7
I take it for granted that a person of an innocent state of mind ... Would rule himself out as a suspect ... And save a busy detective from wasting time .	1
No , I think it's a lot more exciting than that .	8, 2, 5
Let me tell you something about my life .	8
I'm not hiding from anybody or anything !	1
I was weak and tired , Listless , out of sorts , and ...	6
We can't just leave him here .	6
She's not going to , so what difference does it make ?	1, 3
Shut the fuck up .	1, 2, 3
But you're safe .	5
What about a little music ?	2
You're one pain in the ass I don't need .	3
King [PERSON] , voodoo priest of the [LOCATION] posses .	4
I don't want him hollering out any windows either .	1
You're right . I don't have to come , but I wan na tell you something .	8, 4
Oh , no , no , no .	7
Thanks for getting me out of purgatory .	8, 5
He is an integral part of the defense .	8
Humans are dumb .	3
Oh !	7
Fuck , he's not dead !	7
Is it for this that you hold me back from a raid on [LOCATION] ?	7
It's unbelievable .	7
You will pay me back what you owe , with interest .	1, 2
That's all that matters .	8
Because it didn't work .	1
Do something !	1, 4
Sure . Use my box . I'm asking you to watch it with us .	8
They can't do this to me .	4
Are we joined , yes ?	2
[PERSON] will ruin this bank if we don't stop him .	4
Hope this thing don't go off while I'm climbing down .	4
Don't leave without saying goodbye .	6
Qué pasó , shit ! It's the same thing .	3
I bet [PERSON] was porking her ... And taking the money to keep her in style .	3
I hope this doesn't ruin my tryout for cheerleader .	4
To think of her struggles , her fruitless cries for help .	6
I should stay where I belong .	6
OK , thank you , everyone . That's all .	2, 5
I gave [PERSON] ... Enough pain .	6
What are those lights ?	7
I would do anything for the woman that I love .	8, 5
Son of a bitch .	1, 3
Strelnikov is dead . - What ?	7
They may come after the third car .	2
You OK ?	2
Tomorrow we begin again .	2
I'm used to making my deals on a solid basis .	8
I can't seem to keep you two out of the hospital lately .	1, 6, 7
Sister [PERSON] , you play great game of balls . How come ?	2, 5, 7
You really like her , [PERSON] ?	7
How are you going to sing ?	7
Where's the whiny guy ?	2
And hear , actually . The language is something you're never gonna forget .	2
We're the only two people in the world that know , Maxim , you and I.	8
You're going to love International Cafe Society .	5
Nothing we didn't expect .	1, 3
You're goddamn right you got the wrong room .	1
When we are strong ... And are at war ?	2
I'd appreciate your advice before we leave .	8, 2
I was state - raised ... and this is a dead place .	6
You have to have faith .	8
I am dying , and The Nautilus is dying with me .	6
It is nothing like we figured out .	7
He can use one of my horses !	8
Steady .	4
Just look at this crowd .	3
Quick , [PERSON] , we got ta extend the runway .	2
It's not that you fuck around a lot . It's that you lie about it .	1
You let everyone sit around while you took your petty revenge ?	3
Silly old man looking after that young thing .	1, 3
You stole it .	3
I brought you something to drink .	8
Now I want that fucking Texador .	1, 5
My goodness , you have such an attractive little garden here .	7
She's with me now , whitebread .	1, 3
Well , when all this started , I don't think I imagined myself standing here with you tonight .	5, 7
I hate you , [PERSON] !	1
And I refuse to assist you in the rape of the [LOCATION] .	3
We'll have Tobruk in a few days .	2
I'm tired of being pawed .	1
Like a million Fourth of Julys all rolled into one .	8, 2, 5
If he said they're here , they'll be here .	8
Fucking A , sir .	5
Yes , I was responsible .	8
He may not be able to use a spoon .	2
Goddamn it !	1
He was my brother .	6
But when I see you with him , I feel better .	5
Then we'll have brunch by my private lake .	2
I'll respect you even more .	8
She was a crackhead .	3
This technology would liberate Earth from fossil fuels , environmental devastation , and poverty in a single generation .	8, 2, 5
We'll never get to the airport .	4
I am going to report you to the police .	3
Could have used this a week ago .	1
Count could teach me of [LOCATION] .	2
There was a story I heard ... about a wishing stone somewhere on the bank of the [LOCATION] .	2
I'll take my chances .	2, 5
I'll push , but I don't think you'll see them any sooner .	2
These men .	3
Maybe this is God's way of reaffirming your faith .	2
I'm here to admit you and , God willing , help you .	2
Oh , what are you doing here ?	7
It's lovely .	5
We need a doctor , quick !	4
I need to send my thumbprint so they know it's me .	8, 2
Don't worry , kid !	8
All [LOCATION] is here to be in on the kill .	2
You want you and [PERSON] to be tight .	8
Poor lieutenant laker .	6
It's good you no understand my mother . It's liar .	1, 3, 6
Or am I going mad ?	4
How long are you staying in [LOCATION] , please , Mr [PERSON] ?	2
I think you're incredible .	5
Doctor , you're with me .	8
Oh , very nice .	5
He wants it all hush - hush .	8, 2, 4
How did you do that ?	7
There's a lot of charming people hereabouts , [PERSON] .	5
It's only temporary , you know ?	8, 2, 4
I hadn't heard . I'm sorry .	6, 7
Considering who's in the compound , my guess is it's going to be heavily guarded .	2
It's all your fault .	1
We got a good thing goin' here .	5
Lighten up , Chief .	1
Although I think it's a very fine [PERSON] .	5
You know how long l've been looking for you , you spic fink ?	1
I have risen to a difficult task .	4
It was the nearest thing to heaven .	5
Tough guys who didn't crack up like [PERSON] .	8
Would you like a cup of coffee ?	5
We take this , they'll booger us forever !	4
I didn't know I had one .	7
Maybe we better get inside , OK ?	8, 2
Why would a rival biker gang crash a bar full of [LOCATION] ?	1, 7
How tragic .	6
An ... an accident ? Easy , [PERSON] , easy . Watch the rug .	1, 4, 7
I command it !	1
Is that it ?	6, 7
I thought , l 'm in love . 	8, 2, 5
Environmentalists call it a disaster .	1, 7
A boy is dead and my son and husband are still out there .	4
It's just that we have our annual audit coming up and I thought I should probably stay put .	2
You're telling me you are married ? Yeah !	5, 7
You see , [PERSON] , no reason to get angry .	8, 1, 2
What you did to me all those years ago .	1, 3
I never should've left .	1, 3, 6
Another miracle will happen .	2
To me , man is a tremendous creation , an inconceivable thought .	7
Nothing at [LOCATION] .	3
I would like to proudly present the newest member of the [PERSON] family , [PERSON] !	2, 5, 7
Thanks for looking after me , Mac .	8, 5
You're the lion .	8, 4
Alright , let's go , come on ...	2
What an extraordinary mother .	7
When he was a small boy , he charmed us all with his piano playing .	5
I'll be right over .	2
You may not suspect it , but I'm still attractive to some .	1
He wasn't worthy of your loyalty .	3, 6
Well , if he can ...	6
She was coming after me with this gun right in her two hands .	4
I'll give you the money .	8
And we think it's actually their job and they're not doing it .	1
Come on , stranger , hop in .	8
What's wrong with my eyes ?	4
He pumps his face full of Novocaine , and then , with his scalpel begins to slice away his features one by one .	3
The others are getting suspicious .	4
But I can't express myself monosyllabically enough for you to understand 'em all .	3
Just this once , [PERSON] , why don't you empty your own ashtrays ?	1, 3
Give me the suit , right now .	1
Liar !	3
I. . . didn't think I'd ever see you again .	7
But since you insist on being treated as one , I have no choice but to oblige you .	1, 3, 5
This life is not only wicked and sinful .	3
No , not , [PERSON] .	6, 7
So what happens now , eh ?	2
cause snakes are scary .	4
We're prisoners of war .	4
I've got Scotch , I've got vodka , there's a nice Chablis ...	2
How many years to come ?	2, 6, 7
I'm so happy for you .	5
Dear God in Heaven , even these people can't be that mad .	4
I'm not testifying .	1
This is the calendar for the day .	2
Very nice .	1, 5
And He was sent to save us .	8, 2
We were almost there and now all this is going to hold us up .	6
I ain't aiming for you to go to [PERSON] ' and gobble like a hog !	3
No , [PERSON] !	7
What's the matter with you two ?	1, 3, 4
Yes , I have .	8
That's how I feel about it .	8
Guys , look !	2, 5
I think I care too much .	6
Well , that's very poetic .	3, 5, 7
Fuck off , [PERSON] .	1
Follow me !	2
The show is about to commence .	2
Yes , I confess .	8, 4
l knew you were gonna say that .	5
You are quite right , and I do not have the right , but I do love [PERSON] .	6
We don't want speeches .	1
Don't come apart on me now .	4
He's going to get us into trouble .	4
It wasn't because there weren't women that stirred my blood .	5
You made me give up my secrets when I was feeling particularly vulnerable .	1, 6
I'd like to know how she feels about who should be held responsible .	2
I'm sorry for you .	6
That I can not do .	8
When will you start paying the cops so they'll go back to work ?	2
You're jealous that I have [PERSON] , and you've come to take it from me .	1, 4, 6
I don't know if I can afford it .	6
Do I have to bother with that shit ?	3
Violin , soccer , track , friends , uh ... memories with my brother and sister playing .	5
I just want to be alone .	6
And think of her - if she knows nothing , she's safe .	5
This is my team .	8
Take it off !	1, 3, 4
This is my life we're dealing with .	1, 4
Thought she wants to get an education .	7
[PERSON] would not like it .	4
Any of you guys call me [PERSON] , and I'll kill you .	1
Here , at least , I'm a little star .	8, 6
There's a time for everything .	8
How do you live with it , Miss [PERSON] ?	7
Your time comes again .	2
They're rather fond of me .	8, 5
But you'll never find another [PERSON] .	6
Two years an apprentice , and still the nails go in crooked .	1
Look , if I'd have been careful piloting that reconnaissance plane during the war , you wouldn't have had the chance to take the pictures that won you a medal , and a good job , and fame and money .	1
I ought to run him out of the house .	1
That's why I had to find you to tell you .	8
Think much , pea brain ?	3
Unless he had a plan .	2
It's impossible to make a real dent . But it is possible to hurt individual assholes who fuck it up for everyone .	1
You're nothing but a mad scientist !	1, 3
I promise you that .	8
I'll give you a ride back to the chancery .	8
Listen to me !	1
A deal is impossible .	4
I'm stuck with guys down here that are too dumb to roll rocks down a steep hill .	3
Everything we're gonna be eatin' is on this table .	8
You're a good teacher , Frenchy !	8
If you'd like to come with me . Yes .	8
May I help you ?	2
And how do you know that ?	8, 1
He must have a plan .	8
He took six pills in one hour , instead of one every four hours .	4
I'll be in the hotel lobby : sharp .	2, 5
Sex is good for you .	5
Three years I've been waiting to nail your sorry ass .	3
Don't answer it .	4
The good news is Kid here has agreed to sponsor you as a Prospect .	5, 7
You son of a bitch .	1, 3
For God's sake , say something .	4
She told about the squalor and filth into which she and her brother were born , and how they grew up like animals .	3, 6, 7
They got you off the hook for a while .	8, 5
I don't know where I'd be with this bill if it wasn't for your help .	8
Then once you cross [LOCATION] , you're scot - free , that is until ... Dead Dingo Pass .	2, 4
We have a complication .	4
He's gonna do it . Come on !	2
So me and my partner bolt up the stairs , somebody is screaming bloody murder ...	4
The heavyweight champion is down !	7
Now you're going to fuckin' die .	1, 3
That was close , mate .	2, 4, 5, 7
Damn it , shut up !	1
That's a fair question .	8
This is gonna give you a good opportunity to learn to manage money .	2
The coward's code !	3
Why you raising ' up a lady's hopes like that ?	1
Sister [PERSON] , I've got to give the girls their Religious Studies class in fifteen minutes .	2, 4, 7
Stay focused , keep your distance . You must not be revealed .	2, 4
Are you fucking crazy ?	1, 3
I'll get a job until I get a grubstake , and then I'll try again somewhere .	2
You've got me worried , dear .	4
Well , it has a firm hand , I must say it .	7
This looks good .	5
It'll make you cry .	1
[PERSON] , how long has it been since I said I love you ?	6
I guess since I'm here , I got no choice , huh ?	4, 6
I mean , we're talking about one day of work . A day in which I was tied to a cactus and assaulted by snakes .	1
I'll call all your wives and girls for you .	2
If you officers know what's good for you , tell them to stop .	1, 3
Don't you consider this a public responsibility to respond now ?	3, 7
Can I have a bite ?	2
Hey , you told me the only way you survive is because you're a team .	1, 3, 6
A little further .	2, 5
I'm strong , snappy , loving .	5
You're gonna be out for as long as it takes -- weeks , weeks , however long .	8, 2
Get the fuck out of this country .	1
Everything seems to have a bite to it , and I'm smelling like an old sheepherder .	3
I don't think I'll be able to join you fellows after all .	6
That is my greatest and most enduring love .	5
He's so cute .	8, 2, 5, 7
Won't admit that it exists .	6, 7
OCP cut our salaries percent and canceled our pensions . Now they refuse to even talk to us .	1
We saw a real - life example of this last week ...	3
Hey Prospect !	1
They're looking for us , all right .	4
Well , do you plan everything ?	1, 2
She's not really thinking ...	1, 3
Girly , let's go !	2, 5
The princess must not pick the polish from her nails .	3
Certainly making a fool of yourself .	3
That's very thoughtful , Junior , but these are Mom's private drawers .	8, 3
Where is he ?	2, 7
Where the fuck is he ? [PERSON] !	1, 4, 7
Can you play the balalaika ? Can she play ?	2
The feces has struck the air conditioner .	3
She had long , beautiful brown hair and now she had very short , choppy red hair .	6, 7
I'm gonna get the girls .	2
That's perfect .	5
It's delicious , [PERSON] !	5
Every time I think about it , I get sad and depressed , and I'm having flashbacks .	6
Look after you .	4
I'll teach you to make meaningless small talk to everyone ...	3
We're celebrating .	5
He suffered me to buy him a new suit ... and to get him a job at his old hospital .	7
She said that I put on airs . That I use big words like gesture  and  devastate .  	1, 3, 6
Hey , you got ta come in and see this one .	2
It will happen , as it does for all of us .	6
[PERSON] , the lawsuit's dead . We don't have a plaintiff .	1, 4, 6
I can't do this .	4, 6
Yeah , he was a good soldier .	6
I believe whoever killed Detective [PERSON] had recently been in a slaughterhouse .	3
I should've killed him when I had the chance down in [LOCATION] .	1
What he lacked in experience , he's made up in fight .	8
Not another word !	1
Before experience taught me that life is quite tragic enough ...	6
Get your little butt in here .	1
I have a politician who's unable to make a decision .	1
You don't know a damn thing about soldiering .	1
Would you like some coffee ?	2
Why I bother to look so good when there's no one here to admire the end product is beyond me . Know what I mean ?	1, 6
Now no political arguments .	1
I'll make you a millionaire in four months .	8
Fight for real !	1, 6
Just feel how nice it is in here .	5
I didn't give orders for a halt .	1
Heavens , no !	4
Congressman [PERSON] is minutes late as usual .	1
Fine - looking couple , [PERSON] .	5
Sort of , yes , from around the neighborhood .	4
You come with us , and you got a chance .	8
Why can't we have pancakes ?	6
Not too bad .	2, 5
I got a run of three .	5
He should be part of our celebration .	8, 2
I don't see any reason why this witness should not be qualified to give evidence .	8
Argh ! Kaili !	1
It was certainly a heart attack !	6, 7
You should have killed me when you had the chance .	1
Who took her body ?	7
Hiya , kids !	2
Hmm . - ( imitates monkey gibbering )	3
Then again , you never can tell .	7
[PERSON] ? ! Are you Elder [PERSON] traveling incognito ?	7
False alarms were common , And they didn't help our morale .	1
We'll do all we can to help you .	8
He don't care about you and he don't care about me neither .	6
So , what do you want to study ?	8, 2
Money !	5
A [PERSON] saved my life . I just wanted to buy 'em a beer to thank 'em .	8, 2
Queeg endangered the lives of the men .	4
She just seems , I don't know , lonely .	6
That's pretty important , all that .	8
Essex , when will you realize how vital it is not to make enemies at court ?	3
Hey , clown !	1, 3
To be frank , they could be gone by Monday .	8, 2, 4, 6
There . There .	8, 6
I don't think he killed [PERSON] .	8
My heart soars like a hawk .	5
I hadn't spoken to him in and a half years .	2
Yes , I would .	2
Dad , look who's here .	2
But I do , I beat their time .	1
Wiggle your ear . Wiggle your toes . Come on .	5
Of course you can .	8, 5
Give it a try .	2
I refuse to answer , sir .	1
You see , fear is a fighter's best friend .	8, 2
Why didn't you take her home ?	7
We ain't had a chance to get this place too nice .	6
Don't ever leave me .	4
We kill the rebels , we kill the rebellion .	1
Isn't [PERSON]'s death enough ?	4
We got ta do something !	1, 4, 7
Take our offer .	8
What you want ?	3
The penis is evil .	3
What's your problem , jerk off ?	3
Just take a breath .	8
No , no parties for me .	1, 6
Lieutenant , what exactly happened here ?	8, 2
I'd like to speak to ...	2
Do you know something else , my friend ?	8
There's some hot biscuits in the warmer .	8, 5
If we find him , we can deal with the High Priest	2
Then he was relieved unjustly ?	7
♪ I swear by my tattoo ♪	8
Very interesting . They give a good dental plan to you ?	2, 7
There's something , and if I'm right , I think I've solved a murder .	5
Why do the Chinese care so much about what's on this Russian boat ?	2, 4
Oh , that's delicious .	5
Oh , come on . Do me the honor .	1
[PERSON] , where are you ?	4
Showtime .	1, 2
I'm going to tell him someday just exactly what I think of him .	2
For the love of God , [PERSON] .	1, 3
No , don't do it .	3, 4
I'm sorry . - No , that's all right .	8
Oh , but you're not alone now .	8
I'm sorry to have bothered you .	6
Did you have a warrant ?	6
Yes ? - The keys !	4
a man you can look at in the daytime .	5
So you better hit them bunks , my little babies ... or Sergeant [PERSON] with the big toe ... is gonna see how far he can stick it up your ass .	3
You'll see how cold my blood is when that coward comes back !	3
No wonder he's worn out .	6

I loved him , but you know ...	6
I'll go a distance with you to point the way .	8
Is too much heat almost , it is not ?	3
No , I don't need time ...	1, 6
We rumbled . - l mean we rumbled with anybody .	5
Don't you remember ?	7
Only whores smoke in public .	3
And this evidence is clear ... And uncontested .	8
We were wandering around , that's how we got robbed .	4
[PERSON] , what the hell have you done to the coffee ?	3
I'm the one that left you that note today . That's so strange .	4
Let's give her a shout , shall we ?	2
I don't like your faces .	1
Anything you need , I'll call administration and have them authorize the tickets .	8
To find out whether you're a gambler or a trainer .	2, 7

What's he doing there ?	7
You look fabulous .	5
What beautiful roses .	5
Where the hell is Special Weapons ?	1
I'd love to go with you , Mr. [PERSON] .	2
Either you come here to find out the mess , or we take your family .	1
You're our best shot .	8
You'll thank me when you're free .	2
And as for you ... whatever it is you're hatching , forget it , or end up dead .	3
I want to drink a toast to you .	2
I was plenty scared .	4
Spirits soared , women swooned , and gods were created , gentlemen .	5
I got ta stay with her .	8
Fucking bitch !	1, 3
Some soda . Can I have a soda ?	2
Apparently my birth was not considered a blessed event .	3, 6

We speak now tonight ... And these things are never spoken of again .	8, 5
Oh , you're just exactly the same .	1
Go ahead , you can be frank .	8
You steal a little swordfish , and [PERSON] should lighten up ?	7
[PERSON] knew he was taking bribes ?	1, 3, 7
Captain , there ain't no man on earth I'd rather serve under .	8
I was a child .	6
He calls back , and this time he's very frightened .	4
All those guns and violence ...	1, 3, 4, 6
It's a liability .	6
What the hell you doing ?	1
Completely out of our hands . - I don't accept that . - It's out of your hands .	6
Do whatever you got to do to get him into that ring !	2
He wants you downtown , like , yesterday .	1
This goddamn town thinks you're as chicken as they come .	3
I'm my own master ... for the first time in my life .	5
[PERSON] was a good man . Tough break .	6
I'd prefer it if it was you .	8
Don't let it beat you .	8
Unless you're afraid of getting burnt .	1
You don't have to worry .	8
Hi ! Hi Princess ! This isn't really the best time right now .	5, 6
I think he's right . - I don't want to hear it !	3
How sad .	6
My Xobile will do just fine , gentlemen .	8
The sea makes me seasick and I'm afraid of flying .	4
You get in trouble over there , and I'd have a hell of a time gettin' you out .	1
Take your mind off my work .	3
Can not your brother help ?	1
She's a wonderful girl .	8
Over here !	3
Let me just look at you .	2
And just possibly , we will heal Some of our sickly , and / or ... Crippled followers .	2, 5
That butcher , [PERSON] , he'll take head ... and butcher them himself .	4
I'm getting leery of this guy .	3
Cool it ! Or you're gonna get the same thing your boyfriend got .	1, 2
It's a disease .	3

Enjoy with me The pleasures here above	5
Used to go out on double dates together .	5
I thought he didn't have any trusted friends except you .	7
I know that when there's something wrong , you tell me . But there's something going on that you won't let me understand .	1, 4
I think you will find it interesting , Miss [PERSON] .	2
You want me to think that you don't want me to go down there , but the subtle truth is you really don't want me to go down there .	1
Well , actually ...	1, 7
The act of a sick mind with an urge to destroy something young and lovely .	3
I needed it .	5
Hey , there's no one better than old [PERSON] .	5
My grandfather gave this to me just before he died .	8, 6
You're a fool .	1, 3
I would have sent it to you , but I didn't know your address until today .	6
A vocation to love God , help the poor , solace the sick and dying .	8
I am here to pay my respects to the high priest	8
What's the use of getting excited , [PERSON] ?	6
Even though we have each other . It can be a very lonely existence .	6
There'd be less bills if you didn't raise the kids like I was a millionaire .	3
It's like falling off a log .	6
Get those bags in , and get in fast !	1
Poor girl .	6
I think I love you .	8, 2, 5
She's fantastic .	5
You're working on your master's ?	2

Fucking gas company .	1
Where's a good place ?	2
But it's The Neverending Story . I've already read it .	1, 3

[PERSON] , you can have the Giants tickets .	8
Keep to your seat .	1
Just be yourself and you'll be fine . It sounds trite , but it's true .	8
Thank you , but I wouldn't dream of disgracing the family with a divorce .	6
I have too many scars .	6
It's the saga of a man with very little charm and even less courage .	3
Don't a man have a right to know what he's signing on for ?	1
And I have accepted .	2
She gave me a very beautiful scarf .	5
It's a miracle man .	5
We will go as fast as you .	8
Do you know anything about them ?	2
It's a hell of a way to impress my new partners .	1, 2, 4
Fuzzball's our cat .	8
So which way you taking ?	2
There'll be a slight delay .	1
But she can't say that , which means all [PERSON] stole was a meaningless stack of papers .	2
What's this mess ?	3
Smash it ! Rip it !	2, 5
Mishnev is still dead .	6
[PERSON] , what happened ?	7
As I promised .	8
Self - experimentation is against the rules of good research .	3
I'm leaving .	6
I shall live and he shall die .	1
A man who would come here as a virgin .	3
Who's afraid of a little booger ?	3
Hey , don't shoot !	4
We can try .	2
She sure makes this old saloon smell nice !	5
He wanted me ,	2, 4
Don't run away !	1, 6
I didn't like him anyway .	1
Though you may think you're having fun now you only hurt the one you love .	6
She flipped and tried to kill herself .	6, 7
Oh , my God , we're being kidnapped .	4
We have to give them something to hope for .	8
What can we eat ?	2
So here you have a major country , a nuclear power , making a commitment to do this .	3
And it is time that the [LOCATION] government started coming clean on what it's all about , because they're very important military and ...	1
Quiet now , please , everyone pay attention .	2
LEAVE THE DOOR UNLOCKED , UNDRESS , SHOWER , BLINDFOLD YOURSELF AND COME TO BED	8, 2, 4, 7
We came outside giddy and reeling .	5
Please come back , [PERSON] .	6
Get that piece of pigshit out here .	3
You mean , people can hear me now ?	7
Why must I always be the one who puts the cat out .	1
That won't help you .	6
That's the trouble with you .	1
Because I watched [PERSON] go through exactly what you're going through right now .	2
You've murdered a human being !	3
It's great to see you , [PERSON] .	5
Hold it , not yet !	1
The blood's rushing to my head .	1, 4
There's more bad ?	6, 7

Also , I don't like nobody touching me .	3
But he was not here yesterday .	5

Neighbors like each other , speak to each other , care if anybody lives or dies .	1
You frightened me .	4

Now she makes sense .	8
I'm your man . Come anywhere near my old lady , I'll cut your balls off , asshole .	1, 3
Will you help me move the table ?	8
It's a bitter substitute .	6
Did anyone else ?	2
Now , they're probably gonna crown us King and Queen of the Costume Ball .	2
That huge place over there ?	7
You stay and cook one of your raw dinners .	3
I'll take my chances with the gas .	2
He says it's dangerous to spend the night in the village .	4
Looks like a nice day , huh ?	5

I protest against the way in which this question was put !	1
Yes , I love you , too . I'll find you some more .	8
They'll disembowel us .	4
You sure you ain't got me mixed up with somebody else ?	7
What about the treasure ?	7
If the strychnine was not in the coffee and we know that it was not in the cocoa , where it was ?	4
Do we have a deal ?	8

But problems don't just go , [PERSON] , you know ?	6
I shall die on the gallows .	4
Criminal gang unit to take control .	2
Do some more rolling and tossing and thinking about it .	3
You're right . He has turned against me .	6
[PERSON] , please don't go .	4
What time is the next news ?	2
And may the best man win .	8, 2, 5
It's a CIT ?	7
I'm in .	8, 2
You must get lonely .	6
I'd like to meet him , Rock .	2
Hmm , it's a nice place .	5
I thought you didn't --	2, 7
Just in case .	4
Let me see the jewel .	2
Why would he buy a bible ?	7
If he resists , arrest him .	2
They tried .	6
They described a decades long conspiracy to cover up extraterrestrial visitation to [LOCATION] .	1
I wish I had a nickel .	6
Now .	2
Give it up .	1, 3
This is gonna be so great !	2
We're in a war zone , [PERSON] : Two motorcycle officers horribly wounded in a crossfire , the police seemingly unable to rescue them in spite of several desperate , heroic attempts .	6
This looks like a mind - fuck to me .	4
When I'm wearing a new bonnet ... all the figures I ever knew go right out of my head .	6
We have to leave right away . Otherwise we're gonna miss batting practice . Let's go .	2
I didn't know you played a saxophone .	7
Anything that benefits the state is mighty important to me .	8
You named it .	8, 7
No , it's just ... I read in this thing that's what I'm supposed to do .	4, 7
You never spoke about it .	7
Will you arrange a conference for us ?	8
That's wonderful !	5, 7
And whoever holds [LOCATION] points a dagger at the heart of [LOCATION] .	1
It's an incredibly profitable , as horrifying as it is to say , business .	3, 7
It makes my heart sad .	6
I'm not investigating her for working for you , I'm investigating her for felony fraud .	6
There's no way I can have this kind of exposure .	6, 7
I turned pro at and I had eight fights .	8, 5, 7
workingmen stand ready for work on Monday ... on the largest slaughterhouse outside [LOCATION] .  	3
Don't embarrass me in front of [PERSON] .	4
I would hate to commit myself without my compass .	6
They'll be instructed , Captain .	2
It affects her every day .	6
It had to be total and it had to be honest .	8
You got ta get them bones growing .	4
He killed when he was born ... without knowin' it .	4, 6
Turn around !	1
He's dead , isn't he ?	4, 6
Tell me what you gave to him !	1, 3, 5, 7
Good morning !	5
But now , I don't suppose I shall ever see it again .	6
Wait ! Wait right here !	1, 4
Is he gonna be a problem ?	1, 2, 4, 7
And that's another reason why you don't speak about it .	4
You're welcome to join me .	2
I think he wants to die .	2, 6
It's ugly , old and musty .	3
Don't raise your voice to me .	1
It's a new car .	7
She seems very unusual . - Yeah .	3
That was my girl . Wait .	7
You make me very happy .	5
You got to get me out of this mess !	1
Mean gene : He's coming back , Ladies and gentlemen .	2, 5
The most horrible thing was , you'd smile when you were mad .	6
[PERSON] , I've given this a lot of thought .	8
Bad guy .	1, 6, 7
Come on , come on , come on , come on .	2
He shot himself .	3, 4, 6
Cos I knew that if anybody could make me a winner , it was you .	8, 5
I think we can finally nail [PERSON] .	2
Gentlemen ?	2
I can't save [PERSON] .	4
I hope [PERSON] isn't watching .	4
How'd they know you were on this train ?	7
Ah , I'm sorry !	5
Then , you have to go .	6
Don't get too used to those long lunches .	3
Did you try to break into [PERSON]'s house the night of the murder .	1
It'll be broken by dinner .	6
Some people told me you were dumb .	3
Yes . - Well , this is an emergency !	4
Didn't think we'd be getting to see you .	7
You have to take off your shoes .	1, 2
You don't often see a set of charlies that nice .	7
The suspect's body , who we now believe is our Jack the Ripper copycat , was discovered late last night .	7
I thought you weren't coming home till tomorrow .	7
What do you think we ought to do that's fitting and proper ?	1, 2
Oysters are out of season .	3
I'm unhappy .	6
He knows , what I do not understand it is for what reason the Inglethorp it seemed so interested in being a prisoner .	4
I'm not sure how to operate that thing .	4
Yeah , all right , you got a lot goin' .	6
You're right , [PERSON] .	8
I always feared dying in the gutter with a bellyful of booze .	4
What the hell does  it purport to describe ? 	7
You tell him I've got [PERSON] under control .	8, 2, 5
You're making me look bad .	1, 6

Bring her back , girls , alive !	1
Come on , [PERSON] . There's fish in the stream .	2
If we lose , get out of town quick .	4

How many deals do you think get cut in the men's room ?	3
Even so , mon ami .	8, 2
Harry , what do you think would make [PERSON] happy ?	2

She said she's not in a head - space for a relationship , with everything that's going on in the world .	6
Want to get the fuck out of here ?	1, 2
The time had come to look the devil in the eye and send him to hell where he belonged .	3
They had ten ... twenty of them in the back of this panel truck .	6
We're opening a store and a bank , aren't we , [PERSON] ?	2

And don't bother sending a bill , either !	1
I'm sorry this had to happen , [PERSON] .	6
She passed her genes down to you in all the right places .	5
There's no way you could make them talk . You're dealing with extremists .	2, 6
It's a good idea .	5
Retirement , Christ .	2

A performance that exceeded the most optimistic predictions .	5, 7
What do you mean , you can't ?	1
I have a business proposition for you .	2, 5

What are you gonna do all by yourself ?	7
You'll meet him shortly .	2, 5
[PERSON] , leave the room .	1
I don't like your tone .	1
I go back to [LOCATION] today .	2
To be enraged with a dumb brute that acted out of blind instinct is blasphemous .	3
[PERSON] , this is Al.	5
You're a star .	5
It'll all be over by Thursday .	2
The Secretary of State is here . Madam Secretary .	2
How the fuck did you let it get that far ?	1

How hard would it be to crash a wedding ?	2
Now ! Natural , huh ? You on your back , huh ?	1, 2
I could smell it the first day you were born .	2
He's right there !	7
Then , one night , we were talking about how we hated the life , and how we had never done much of anything ourselves .	6
I'm not stupid , Mr. [PERSON] .	1
I love my ass .	5
Put it down	1
Isn't that terrible !	4
Who will write the ... digest ?	2
I don't want you to forget what you've seen here today .	8
I will not return to prison .	1

What is he looking at ?	2
Surprise !	5
It would be a start if you'd let [PERSON] go .	1
You could make a handsome profit on your stock .	2
Don't look !	4
But do you truly believe that by deliberate present - day action we can neutralize that possibility and alter the future ?	7
Put them down and turn your back .	1
I think she's great .	5
I can't hold the wheel .	6
We're going to celebrate .	2
I've never felt more alive in my whole life .	5
What am I doing here , [PERSON] ?	7
And I'm warning you .	1
I think I'll take a nice dose of sleeping pills tonight .	6
Senator [PERSON] , I'm pleased you could make it .	5
What good is it to cut off your heads ?	3
Oh , [PERSON] ! God !	4
I'll get a job .	2
I didn't know anybody was going to be killed .	4
I'd like to introduce you to ...	2
No morality ?	3
It's like they're running an errand , and they happen to spot the one they love across the street running a different errand .	7
I was fixed up on a blind date by a well - meaning friend .	8, 5
They're gonna get nervous .	4
Now , you stay put and listen to me .	1
And we are now beautiful .	5
Scatter and keep your mouths closed .	1
And they told me that you weren't that smart .	7
Glad to see I'm not the only case you're working .	5
And I might add that he has some rather strong ideas On the subject of sea monsters .	8, 2
What the hell is this , [PERSON] ?	1, 7
Are they both mad ?	7
I do hope it won't affect your ego !	3
What did he tell you to tell me ?	1, 2
Do you know , you were pretty cute in there today , my little .	5
There's gonna be a lot of clowns out there with firearms and itchy fingers .	3

Not even the pleasure of seeing you free ... Can make up for this ... This disgrace to the cause of justice .	1, 3, 6
My favourite colour's blue .	5
I got to take care of my cattle .	8
Such personal questions are not appropriate .	1, 3
Father , maybe we could ... Go in the other room and speak privately ?	4
You can get brave any time you feel like it .	5
And I fear no one , Especially an unholy spirit from an unsavory world .	1, 2
Watch it , it's still wet .	4
I hate this frigging place .	1
You'd better listen to what he said .	1
Ain't much you can do about us .	1
I wan na say I appreciate what Capt. [PERSON]'s done on my behalf .	8
Don't touch me !	3
They think you can do it .	8
You really think you know what's best for us , [PERSON] ?	1
Why do you say that ?	7

It's such a pleasant little place .	5
You have our deepest sympathy .	6
Let me talk to her . Let me just talk to her .	2, 4
You think it was me that beat you ?	6
Because you know I'm gonna walk out of that court , just like I did before .	2
I couldn't hate you , so my hatred turned into an insane fear .	4
I need some protection now from [PERSON] .	4
So , I'm gonna call her back , and you are going to apologize .	1
It was an avalanche .	4

Big house , three cars , beautiful wife .	8, 5
Don't you forget that I'm still the headman around here , too .	1
Been here long ?	2
It's not enough .	4, 6

That only took two seconds .	7
They look like giants .	4, 7
I've got something down here .	2, 5
Let me have those things .	2

[PERSON] , I'm not interested in this . Of course you're not .	6
Claymore's gonna cut his nuts off faster than a hedge clipper .	1

We'll arrest him .	1
Hundreds !	7
( imitates monkey gibbering )	2, 5
My little [PERSON] .	8
When did you get back ?	7
Oh , no , don't worry about me .	8
It drags at your heart till ... you can't do anything but look back .	6
With this rate of tariff , I'm confident it'll have a mitigating effect on the anti-dumping cases .	8
Trouble is that the Kid might be nervous , big game like this .	4
You really believe you can frighten me ?	3
I'm going to need you to put your hands up .	8, 1, 6
We want to die !	6
Please , this job means everything to me .	4
I wish I could have made her understand .	6

You're really gonna like the way Adrian cooks .	2, 5
You really and truly are a perfect bastard .	3
I was taking out on her what I should have been giving you !	3
You're thinking she's a fool for doing it , even if it saved your hide ...	3
Strange that I should be called a destitute woman when I have all these riches locked in my heart .	3
[PERSON] , it's impossible !	4
I'm even ready to mambo .	8, 5
I'll speak with you first .	2
Oh , [PERSON] , no .	6, 7
Rushing home to a hot apartment to listen to the automatic laundry and the electric dishwasher and the garbage disposal and the nagging wife .	3

You look a little off - colour , [PERSON] .	4
She's got the curse .	4
Give him a break , would you ?	1, 3
Isn't it divine ?	5
You don't realise what a plum you are for us .	5
Too much time !	4
That thing is a killer !	1
[PERSON] , you had no right to do something like that .	1
Drop that cannon .	1
It was horrible for him .	6
We're going to open !	2
There is to be no retreat , not so much as one millimeter .	1
[PERSON] did everything he could , but they got away .	6
Where are you taking it ? - To the hospital .	6, 7
Don't open that .	4
Yet somehow I felt within myself a new source of power .	5
Don't let me go down .	4
Happiest CS - Three anyone ever met .	5
Father , make us truly humble and thankful ... for these and all the other blessings .	5
How much longer ?	3
I think it's brilliant .	8, 5
In that case , why don't you go to that last table ... sit down , shut up , and don't move ?	1
To you , and to our new partnership , welcome .	2, 5
Hey , would you like to dance ?	2
That chorus , they work really hard .	7
A command is a lonely job . It isn't easy to make decisions .	6
It's time I faced up to what I do have to do .	8, 2

Cody , please ! You must listen !	1
About [PERSON] , you told me that your husband [PERSON] deserted you .	6
[PERSON] , show him the paper .	2
They'll shit down their pants and run like rabbits .	3, 4
You find it hard to believe that this is not just a dream you dreamed a long time ago .	2
Hey , daddy's friends are here .	2
Okay , everybody out . The party's over .	1, 2, 3
Bullshit ! What do you see ?	1, 2
Why don't they use something easy to get ?	7
He's killing me .	4
Just when I think you're dead , you always come back .	7
This is okay .	8
I'd never leave you , Daddy .	8
I tell you , our side will always win .	8, 5
This is a whole new world to me .	2
You found her .	5, 7
Very well . I understand , doctor .	6
Yes , but he went off without me , didn't he ?	1, 6
If I'd only figured it out before maybe we wouldn't have been trapped down here .	6
You found courage .	8, 5
You are an old man who will make trouble with his mouth .	3
Are you sure it's him ?	4, 7
The wise man gets drunk to spend his time with fools .	3
I don't believe you . - You can't accuse me , sir .	1, 4
Mark , I was the one who had the worm . Thank you .	1
You want to go ?	2
It's cute , isn't it ?	2
There she sat , gazing at me with her big eyes .	7
I married [PERSON] because I was in love with him .	8, 5
I look great !	8, 5
Are you really a singer ?	7
She's on her way . - Fine .	1

What the hell are you talking about ? We had drinks last night .	1, 7
Ahoy , there !	2, 5

That's why you and [PERSON] were special .	8
Come on up for just a few minutes .	2
Get pencils and paper , quick !	2
I want the whole morning edition a blast to push him off the floor .	1
That's when they come . That's why they're called surprises .	2, 5, 7
Can you think of something else ?	2
You should not be afraid to touch me .	8
However many questions you ask , you never expect an answer .	1
Absolutely .	8, 5
The judges that are making these decisions are gonna be read about in history .	8, 2
For God's sakes , be careful out there !	4
The van is waiting to take you to your  Live at Noon  spot .	2
What's the matter , kids ?	7
That's how wars start .	6
You just enjoy your wine . I know , you've told me .	5
Who , you mean the current acting President of the [LOCATION] ?	7
Terror tactics , man .	1, 4
Everybody calls you plain [PERSON] , why can't I ?	1

You little bastard .	1
Are you mocking me ?	1
What should we do , moron ?	3
They're savages , savages	3
It's not mine . Do you still claim you have an identical scarf ?	1
You have destroyed us .	4
A deception ?	4
I never see anything happen .	6
I want to overthrow the Grand Duchess .	2
It's not so simple . What the hell isn't so simple ?	1
That will be enough , [PERSON] .	1
One thing ... Admiral [PERSON] only allowed us planes ...	4
You know I told you that [PERSON] and I are going to get married ... when he comes back from the maneuvers .	2
I hardly recognize him with his mouth closed .	3
There'll be someone , don't worry .	8
What the hell happened in there ?	1, 7
I was just an ensign .	6
If you don't , somebody else will .	1, 7
I , uh ...	6
I want to meet my mother .	2
Darn it , [PERSON] .	1, 3
Turned out that my father and his business partner were involved in a Ponzi scheme .	1, 3
I'm not some gun for hire .	3
I'm very sorry about that , Miss.[LOCATION] . .	6
Let them look .	8
I'd like to see the rest of the guns now .	2
But I'm very happy to have met you .	5

And now the kidnappers are playing them against each other , trying to get the $ million .	4
Oh , shit , he's here .	4
What are you looking at me like that for ?	1
How about paying for something you drop by accident ?	3
Check it out .	2
Some gang !	8, 1, 5
A wonderful idea .	5
Is it ... and look who's there !	5, 7
But , they might be ready to make a go of it on their own .	8, 2, 5
I didn't hear no bell !	1
I'm grounded .	6
Oh , shit .	4, 6
But I think you'll enjoy his game .	2, 7
I didn't even have time to wash my hair today .	6
It went ' pop . ' Exploded .	8
That spark and fire I used to see in her eyes is gone .	6
What money , asshole ?	1, 3
I got it , but I don't know .	8, 6
They were beautiful once .	5
As she told me of all the things that they did to protect children .	2, 5
It can't be a coincidence it lays out this way , [PERSON] .	4
No . And I'm sure you understand that , sister [PERSON] of the Annunciation .	1
Goddamn , that thing's got more holes than my daddy's rubber .	3
I cheat . So does she . But I cheat better .	5
Hi , Pa.[LOCATION]	8, 5
And I hate the way you drive , and I hate your stinking whiskey breath .	1
Everything is cold and finished .	6
Did it ever occur to you , [PERSON] , that the prince looked everywhere for [PERSON] just so that he could put the shoe back on her foot ?	1
God , I'll lose him .	4
I can't stand it here any longer .	1
Sorry , boys .	6
First of all , I'd like to thank everyone who supported me in my race for Mayor .	5
You didn't say grace .	1
Deal them up , Shooter .	2
I'd rather be dead .	6
What , do you think I consider it recreation ?	7
Well , then , I'd say the reason that you broke up is important .	8
Why is he letting him go ?	7
Outrageous !	1
Hey , would you get a load of this joint ?	2
lmprovise .	8
This one is getting too popular .	1, 3, 7
To tell you the truth , [LOCATION] frightens me .	4
Another big guy , he pulls his badge , and he says :	4
And if he doesn't get it , he goes into bankruptcy and throws 900 , men out of work .	4
He was trying to stop it .	4
No , no , I will not go crawling back to that woman	3
Bring her .	1, 3, 4
You homo !	3
I just got a great idea for the campaign . Can you come over ?	2
Yeah , I'm afraid it is , [PERSON] .	6
If you ever had a sense of humor . When you finish testifying ,	1
When was the last time you saw her ?	6
You're gonna die .	1, 3
Now he takes an utter stranger into the family .	3
We're looking at economic instability , we're looking at housing instability .	6
But there's an insurance log that monitors how much money is in the bank at any given time .	6
What do you want to do about the body ?	4
A man I've admired and worshipped all my life .	5
And so I clicked it and ... There was the pictures of my daughter .	7
It's not going to go that far .	3
Yeah , um , are we starting the interview now ?	4
Look , it's [PERSON] !	7
Heh heh . Hear my words , demon . I will cast thee from this poor woman's soul ,	2
Only a gourd - head would ask a stupid question like that .	3
I wanted to blame myself for my dad's drinking , for my mom's crying all the time and her emotional breakdown .	6
I heard had good marinara sauce . How was it ?	2
Shut up ! - I want out of here .	1
The world will someday see paintings of her . And of her and me . And then it will think ,	2, 5
Told you not to call me that .	1
Of course , Countess !	8
I don't want to argue .	6
So my father was murdered .	4
Will you go along with their agenda ?	2
Their style , but where the hell did they go ?	1
I mean , it's man's favorite subject .	2, 5
Our friend  [PERSON] . 	3
You have a very nice little boy , madame .	5
You know I don't understand that shit .	1
Some day you can punch out your pop .	1, 2
It puts him in the area within one hour of the first killing .	4
Let me try .	1, 2, 5
We can't have that .	1, 6

You knew when I point blank asked you , and you lied to me about it .	1, 3, 6
Oh , sure . Cry all you want . 	3
Oh , you must be from around here .	7
Hey , that's it .	5, 7
I live in one room for 8 , years and I'm tired of it .	6
I asked you to come here today to discuss the sale of your formula .	8
I knew I couldn't trust you .	3
Yours will , depend on it . Because you're like all criminals , you're greedy .	3
To avoid bringing disgrace upon a clean and honourable state .	6
Let's forget it .	8, 1
And secure for sea . Aye , sir .	2, 5
I've slaved in that man's factory for years and years .	6
You really are trying to kill me , aren't you ?	4, 7
The opera starts an hour later tonight on account of the parade .	2
No pension plan , no insurance .	1, 6
He went after him like ...	4
Nobody can do that , ... Except you .	8, 5
[PERSON] , they just caught this guy .	7
I will . This isn't exactly comfortable for me . I know you wanted this job .	6
I'll never forget what you've done .	8
I've been trying to find you , but ...	6
So we're gonna stop off and see her on the way back .	2
All other movements are restricted .	1, 2
Well , because that makes sense .	2, 5
He'll be at the beach tomorrow .	2
I wouldn't have missed this for anything .	5
The clerk said she left with one of those two Cuban Hebes .	4, 7
You did not bore me .	7
That's what friends are for .	8
We should set an example , [PERSON] .	2
I feel so bad for [PERSON] .	6
Foo - foo is a good dog .	5
It wasn't her fault , honest it wasn't .	4
We'll relieve you in a couple of hours .	2, 6
That's bad management .	3
Thank you for protection .	8
Tell them to get the hell out of there .	1
You have to stay indoors to avoid them .	4
If the rights of the individual are not respected by the group , the group can not exist .	1
So much fun and imagination .	5
Let's go to St.[LOCATION] .	2
You always blame me !	1
Who is he ?	7
I can hear the fat lady singing , [PERSON] . I can hear her singing .	2
Honey , babe .	8, 5

I wanted to be there so I could be close to you .	2
Have them send me up some roast chicken and chocolate pudding .	2
Good afternoon , Mr. [PERSON] !	5

You know the streets . You know the dealers .	8
I'll shoot the son of a bitch in the balls !	3
Do you wan na make love ?	2
You're making no sense here .	1
I will make war on the world over , without mercy !	1
How great can you kiss ?	7
Maybe when I come back , the two of us ought to spend some time alone .	2
That means we're in grave trouble .	4
I should feed a strange mouth ?	3
It could get you in trouble .	4
You get a bonus and a raise .	8
Your opinion is that this was ... A staged rape ?	6, 7
If you're saying what I'm thinking you're saying , you better not say it because I don't wan na hear it .	1
Look how big it is !	7
Jesus !	7
Oh , feet !	5
Did you say Army ?	2
If they does , I'll guarantee they'll never see nothin' again !	8, 1, 2
Not [PERSON] ?	7
I can not believe it .	4, 6, 7
But I need to know where it is .	1
He must keep you on overtime .	4
I've never seen such activity .	7
An event which doubles the pleasure I take in wishing you and them a most happy and prosperous New Year .	5
Don't forget the cannibals .	4
Do your friends put money in your pocket , [PERSON] ?	3
Look around , dummy . You see any wires ?	3

OK ? You ready ?	2
He'll never give up .	8, 2
Why were you hiding the evidence ?	3

You're probably wondering what I'm doing here in this box. ,	7
Oh , [PERSON] , I'm worried about what you'll do at the inquest tomorrow .	4
We march tonight .	2
Pull those drapes !	1
Why even tell me about it ? Because I needed to tell you !	1
We're going to ... - , get out of there !	1, 4
But there is nothing to be alarmed about .	8
The professor wants to talk to me .	2
We have an emergency .	4
You really believe that ?	3
Isn't this the finest time ?	5
This is exactly when we should strike .	2
We thought you might like to look through his papers .	8
Clearly , you're not like everyone else .	8, 5, 7
It's an old saying by an old crow .	3
Hey , don't piss on any firewood !	3
Don't push it !	1, 4
Right , Lieutenant ?	7
Might take a few days to finalize , but yeah . It's happening .	2
Thank you , [PERSON] .	8, 5
That would only make him less unhappy .	5
Sounds right to me . OK .	8
We're kickin' the shit outta everybody .	1
I'm ashamed of you .	3
Well , this looks like a cool color .	5, 7
I've got to go to [LOCATION] , first plane .	6

The things are walking fast , my friend . Perhaps fast too much .	7
My , we're a jolly crew , aren't we ?	5
Melancholy sight .	6

Pull yourself up .	1
We've got to get out of here .	4
Father , what's going on here ?	7
And I'm tweaking . I'm outta money .	6

[PERSON] , you're so sweet to worry about [PERSON] like this for me .	5
Of course . You're a big supporter of my opponent .	8, 1, 3
Go !	1, 2, 4
That's the unholy pity of it .	6
What are you trying to do to me ?	1, 2, 4
Why did you take him then with me ?	1, 6, 7
You've got a customer .	8, 2
What are you doin' here ?	7
Why you drinkin' that cold coffee ?	7
Are you gonna retire or not ?	3
You're going down	1
Look , I better go !	2
I said , shall we start ...	2
You make me sick when you speak , [PERSON] .	3
Mayii : His stomach was acting up like a schnauzer in heat . Would they believe him ?	2
Now's not a good time .	6, 7
Not a happy one .	6
I really liked the idea .	5
Bird leaves at . Be there or swim . We got more coming !	2
What have you been drinking ?	3
Because we are food for worms , lads .	3
Morning . - Hey , babe !	8, 5
In fact , I'm not doing anything tomorrow .	2
All right , [PERSON] .	8
How can you be so inhuman ?	3
Tell her about our special student housing program .	2
There will come a time , when those who sit above me will want you delivered .	3
That's why audiences love me .	5
[PERSON]'s crying ! [PERSON]'s crying !	4
[LOCATION] laughed at my theory .	6
Well , I want to thank you and your wife for all your help .	8
Well , can you give me what he has ?	2
We thought you'd be safer on the ground .	8
All I asked you is where the hell [PERSON] is .	1
Were you together ? Yeah .	2, 5, 7
It's all over , [PERSON] .	6
I can't do that , [PERSON] .	1, 6
Just promise me you'll see a doctor as soon as you get there , okay ?	4
Well . I didn't ask if it would fit . I asked how much it was .	1
Did the kids get to eat all right ?	8
I can't keep him . He's getting farther away .	6
I'd like your support .	8, 6
Go back to the perimeter , you pinhead .	1
There is a pilot on the radio telling her what to do , telling her exactly how to do it .	8
Isn't that rather exposing the First Lady to some risk ?	4
Come on , let's move .	2
Stall their deliveries , push them off the streets !	1
We will now take an oath	8
If you ask me , this is the worst case of downright rudeness I've seen .	3
Where's [PERSON] ? Who cares ?	1, 3
That's a foolish article of yours .	3
Whatever action needs to be taken to address this problem , needs to be taken .	1, 2
I'm going to college but hoping to do volunteer work in the summer .	2
Let's face it .	3
[PERSON] , I came to say goodbye .	6
He is not only older and wiser but his present trouble has taught him precaution .	8
[PERSON] planted something up in his office to frame me .	3
[PERSON] is dead .	6
Of course you're going in .	8
Let's keep this a perfect memory ... and someday this bitter ache shall pass , my sweet .	6
Okay , girls , go get them !	2
But to speak of this , to anyone , would bring dire consequences .	4, 6
What are you giving me ?	2
You don't have a boy !	1
No worries .	8, 2, 5
Old man , my last name isn't Chow !	1
If I hadn't seen you on the news , I wouldn't have known who his partner was .	2, 7
Let's make the most of it .	5
If she succeeds , the consequences will be disastrous .	4
I told you that swords are too dangerous !	1, 3, 6
It's not exactly the Ritz , but it's peaceful and quiet .	5
This , you would buy at a store and take it to a party if you wanted to get big laughs .	5
Bodies strung out , bodies with the skins ripped off , the hearts torn from the cadavers .	3, 6
I saw it coming , but what could I do ?	6
They're very nice .	5
You won't believe this .	7
Don't you think that life should be gay and bright and bubbly , like champagne ?	5
Don't ruin it .	1
Be happy in your work .	5
Don't go up .	4
What sort of a man are you ?	7
I ain't gonna call her any more .	1
I don't need marked cards to beat you , pal .	1
This will make you famous , hmm ?	2
Are you sure it was there ?	7
Said it was ghastly .	4
You've got to get there before sundown .	4
She has a lovely time .	5
Your skin stinks of it .	3
That's much better .	5
Here's a great one .	5
It's serious trouble . So many dead and wounded .	4, 6
You ... shut up !	1
I asked you never to speak to me again .	1
You're not afraid , huh ?	8, 2, 7
For once in my life , I'm telling --	1
Take care of her , Mr. [PERSON] .	8
Scram the son of a bitch .	1
You think I killed her .	6
I know the feeling .	8
That's not competitive . That's ambition and talent .	5, 7
I wonder if you'd like to see my bathroom ?	2
This company of adults made the decision to post these pictures without even taking the time to find out if they were children .	1, 3
Outstanding .	7
Get off me ! Get off me !	1, 4
Open your eyes !	4
We were a team .	1
Leave it !	1
You'll stay on a nice boat .	5
I can not begin to tell you how sorry I am ... That any of this has taken place .	6
We say who , we say when , we say how much .	8
Don't even , no . Don't look at me !	3
I have to live every single day of my life now with everything that's happened to me .	6
Never return to [LOCATION] .	3
Every day it was worse .	4
What ? I think we've found ourselves an angel .	7
Leon , I want to confess .	8
Bring my gun when you come back !	1
Would we have approved killing him in babyhood when he was innocent , or killing his mother , or slaughtering his remote ancestors ?	3
Mr. [PERSON] wants to know how come he don't know you .	5, 7
You said you'd never leave me .	6
You poor son of a bitch .	1, 3
Well , that was a personal matter .	1
In fact , I'm just about to haul nuggies .	5
Hey , wait for me .	4
♪ She swapped me for a trout ♪	5
He's peeking at us through the curtains .	4
Everything there can be interpreted as an attempt to enforce discipline .	1, 3
Let me get you a transfer , sir .	8
He was the technology .	8, 7
Hey , what's up you guys ?	5
Who is this woman ?	7
Did the Lord say : His Pa is a sinner and not meant to be happy ?  - No . 	1
Prepare to dismount !	2
So that I could sit in that Senate and serve the people in an honest way .	8
It is not usually he writes to me .	2
Can you get me some heavy downers ? Something that'll really make me sleep .	2
When we go , you go !	8
I like !	5
We'll meet at the rear of the hotel .	2
Oh , what a delightful child .	5
Well , she did sort of embrace it once she did .	5
You want to look out at a peaceful scene ?	2
Don't be rummaging through my private documents , [PERSON] .	1
You're good , but you're taking on a lot .	6
Get rid of him , [PERSON] .	3
Hear me , vain and foolish mortal woman .	3
You do not understand .	4
My mental facilities are twice what yours are , you pea brain .	1, 3
This is a surprise .	7
There's nobody left around here now .	6
But I love you . I want you , [PERSON] .	8, 5
You were told about the vortex ?	7
You are a mutant .	3
Will you give me a shot of the valedictorian Getting her diploma ?	2
Dad !	1, 4, 6
All right . Mind your shoving ' , mate .	5
[PERSON] dear , have a nice holiday in [LOCATION] .	5
You gonna call me a frequent flier , too ? Who called you a frequent flier ? I heard one of the nurses say that about me outside .	1
Mind your own business .	1
Could [PERSON]'s carriers do a reconnaissance job for us ?	2
This is adorable .	5
They want names . I give them names .	1
Well , you're quite welcome , son .	8, 5
May we hear our next bid , please ?	2
Shelleen , it was a great plan !	5
You go for the piano for the first month .	7
Hello . You must be [PERSON] .	2
There isn't anything to do .	6
A. . . pointless award ?	6, 7
All we want is to live on the land of our fathers in peace .	4
100 % truthful , Ace ? - Yeah .	8, 7
As often as I could , I went to see him at his villa near [LOCATION] .	8
Your Highness slept well ?	8, 2, 5
These men are loyal and devoted .	8
I like your tie , too .	5
It adds a few miles to our trip , but somehow I've become a little sentimental .	6
Yesterday I was greatly amazed when I came from the market ... and found you'd made your bed , sir .	7
Well , thanks for the flowers and everything .	8
Because of this attempted prison break , [PERSON] would have to serve additional time .	3, 6, 7
I loved your drawing .	5
Yes , can I have the Command Duty Officer , please ? Thank you .	2
And I don't want someone coming here when you do tell them after you hang up .	3
But , Mr. [PERSON] , what about ... ?	4
Well done !	5
I'll tell you , two out of three of those judges do not use the internet .	1
Old man , why are you carving my name ?	7
[PERSON] talked with the Inglethorp and it goes away .	2, 5
You might have noticed I've got a slight weight problem .	6
Your client knows that if I go to jail , he and his friends will go with me .	4
Havin' the best and wearing ' the best .	5
I'd rather negotiate with you any day .	8
You know this guy !	1
Oh , [PERSON] !	8, 2, 5, 7
May I ? May I ?	2, 5
[PERSON] , why are you so cross ?	7
He spent money on a bible ?	7
Can you still keep going on ?	4
Don't fuck with me on this one , [PERSON] .	1
This is a man's world , a brutal world .	6
You could have alerted us !	1
This is great .	5
The brain surface neurons in this area have also been traumatised .	6
Mr [PERSON] , you've fallen in with thieves .	1, 3
Get outta the way .	1
What was that crack ?	4
How very nice of you to say .	5
You're drunk .	3
The guy was just talkin' about gettin' a shot .	4
Did anybody ever tell you that you smell like the future ?	5
Hsiao - tsing ? !	7
I shouldn't have hit [PERSON] , shouldn't have picked up the telephone ...	6
The phone is dead .	6
Oh my God ! You guys are all a bunch of freaks .	7
I was brilliant .	5
It's nice to have somebody to say goodbye to .	5
Yeah , this is really beautiful .	5
Listen , I know it's last minute ... but I wan na ask you , are you free tonight ?	2
You are dead inside .	3
What if Case tortures her ?	4, 7
What's going on , [PERSON] ?	4
Looks like this case will be settled in no time .	5
No , don't touch that !	4
How can you think that I could do a thing like that ?	3, 6, 7
You said the party's over .	1
Now , this man is good .	7
No , he's no [LOCATION] .	4
This is quite a pleasant surprise .	7
There ought to be some ...	7
Come on , do what I tell you !	1
Otherwise , I fear not only for the safety of our men , but frankly , for their lives as well .	4
I can't find the right words .	6
And he who spies and flies away lives to spy another day .	7
If that's humor , don't bother .	1
Imagine , [PERSON] , you'll be the first .	2
There are many problems attendant to running such a large territory .	4
You love your brother ?	3, 7
Now , don't worry , darling , we understand perfectly .	5
It's nice and clean in here .	8
He polluted their guts with language that shouldn't be inside of no man !	3
I saw the same book in her room .	7
They would have waited forever to go into that bank .	1, 2
But if I don't hear from you in a week , me and [PERSON] are going to disappear .	8, 4
I want to be fair .	8
A lot of fun you are .	5
You're late , maricón .	1, 5
I'd say the odds against a successful escape are 100 , to one .	4
Ensign [PERSON] called and told me that you were in trouble .	1, 7
It don't look good , Miss B. I can't see any way out of this one .	8, 4
The most valuable asset against Sandstorm that we've got , and instead of turning him to our side , we're actually pushing him away .	1
That extension was a power of attorney , [PERSON] !	1
That's incredible .	7
How are you going to stop them ?	4
Look , what you've done .	3
And he will be missed .	6
Before we go , you must play the piano for us .	2
But I will not attempt one here and now .	6, 7
[PERSON] , keep that mule's asshole away from me before I have to break him .	3
Come and sit down .	2
Lovely lads and so natural .	8, 2, 5
And I say again , mate , I'm coming in !	2
So , you are not seriously hurt ?	2
I'm going to smoke when I go outside .	2
He don't get it .	3
Now it's show time .	2, 5
She's using what she read in the paper to get attention or a little cash .	2
The bride on whom the rain doth fall .  	5
All right , what's happenin' out there ?	2, 4
Who's there ?	2
I don't know what the hell to do .	4
Do you remember what to say ?	8
You'll never mean anything but misery to any man .	3
I'm behaving like years old .	3
It's what you got to lose .	2
That's absurdly hypothetical .	6, 7
They trust me .	8
Trubel , run !	4
And so , people of the press city officials in a few minutes Omni Consumer Products and the troubled city of [LOCATION] will join in a bold new venture .	2
A real Jekyll and [PERSON] .	3
Half of [LOCATION]'s on the way up here .	2, 7
If we increase the number of squads and specialise their functions I'm certain the total daily output can be increased by 30 , percent .	8
That it's , uh , you know ...	3
I'm in fear of my life , you know .	4
Didn't you understand that ?	7
Leave us the hell alone !	1
Collaborating with President [PERSON] is always a mistake .	1, 3
I want the truth now , no flannel .	1
Seven passengers and two crewmen were killed .	6
But when I told the police , I do not think they believed me .	6
Listen to me and keep still .	1
Could be .	2
That should give you the real overview of where we're headed .	2
Me , too .	8
So maybe death isn't the end , [PERSON] .	2
I'm an actor , see ?	2
I was crazy with jealousy .	6
Been trying to raise him for hours .	1
I thought you got lost .	4
I'd waited so long !	6
Can't you find me a key ?	8
Yes , I do . - No , you can't !	1, 3
Let's get down to particulars .	2
You might hold this for me .	8
What's he got to do with this thing ?	1
It's another little reminder of why we pulled this thing .	1, 2
Get off of that train .	1
My wife , poor girl .	6
Make you mighty happy , I bet ya .	5
The most damning testimony ... Comes from an abused and frightened child ... Who overcame his fear and his pain ...	6
[PERSON] , are we leaving ?	7
This is where you'll be living .	8
What do you want , Cat ?	1
My old friend . Not safe .	6
I'm saved !	5
This is something that nobody has ever heard about or seen before .	2
Who wants to go take a look at the city ?	2, 5
Here . Relax , fella .	8
This is all a cover - up .	3
You spoil me for death .	3
We can protect you . If you stay here , they're gonna find you .	8
We love you .	5
She didn't become a Hexenbiest because she wanted to .	3, 6
And you're it .	7
It's a dead man .	3
And what I want is for you to befriend him .	2
What made you think you could get in ?	7
Nobody leaves unless I say so .	1
My brother is in prison .	6
What the fuck are you doing with those ?	1
Have Doc take a look at him .	8
[PERSON] , [PERSON] , [PERSON] .	3
I'm not afraid of you .	1
I just happen to be taking the same train .	7
I resolve you ... Absolve you !	8
We'll set it all up .	8
We don't know where the hell we are .	4, 6
You were too rough the last time !	1
It's gonna be very dangerous .	8
Help us .	8, 4, 5
Get me someone you trust .	8
Will you be blessing this house with your presence for dinner ?	2
Still working on my dissertation at my age . It's ridiculous .	1
We don't wan na miss her , boy , we wan na get there first .	2
[PERSON] , you sure have a nose for talent , you know how to find them and train them .	8
You think I'll ever forget you running from that stupid clown ?	3
You hate me .	6
And you will call me in a couple of days .	2
[PERSON] , are you okay ?	4
It is you whom I love , much more than this .	8, 5
You still serve that dull , grey stupidity .	3
I'm talking about a fantastic international extravaganza , to be held in [LOCATION] , called Lettin' It Go In [LOCATION] .	2
Wan na go have some fun ?	2
They say he killed a man when he was 12 , years old .	4
♪ ' Bout the flapping ' fish and the girls I've loved ♪	5
We're rich !	5
That Englishman wants a fight ?	1, 2, 4
How about that drink ?	2
OK , but it's the last time I set foot in this house .	8, 1
You look terrific .	5
Every living being is capable of attack ... if sufficiently provoked .	1
Oh , my goodness !	8
Come on . The whole point of these takeovers is to sell off the assets and put old farts like me out to pasture .	1, 3
I guess you're right again .	8
Do you feel the ecstasy , [LOCATION] ?	5
Thank you for stopping , you saved my life !	8, 5
Is this some sort of a gag ?	7
Ring the alarm !	4
Do as he says , everyone .	8
I'm sorry . I'm just frustrated .	3, 6
There's coffee on the stove .	5
Who do you think you're punishing , huh ?	1
Get Off !	1
Let's go to a nice place .	2
Why can't this guy stay on the ground ?	1
You'll be glad to hear that the lift was working this morning .	5
Bastards !	3
There are whores in [LOCATION] who have carved my name on trees .	3
My grandfather wouldn't have anything to do with him .	1
I've got to appoint a new senator .	2
Well , I suppose I should thank you .	8, 6
We had something special , but it's over .	6
What are we doin' here ?	2, 4
They're watching us .	4
Don't you find that kind of disturbing ?	3, 4
I must have you .	2
You dare take that tone with me ?	1
I don't like reporters .	1
Not fully .	6
It's certainly a pleasure to see you .	5
Don't touch the money !	1
Look at all these happy families .	7
Really , I've never been happier .	5
I know you'll take good care of it .	8
How you doing , [PERSON] ?	2, 5
What are you going to do ?	4
We'll let them decide . Face the window .	3
Fifty of them froze to death in one night .	6
Who in the hell you looking for ?	1
At 10:00 , tomorrow morning , I want you to bring into my office either a letter denying emphatically that your remarks had any mystic implications or a letter of resignation .	1
That I knew how miserable you were with him ?	6
This is as far as we dare to take you .	4
I need to talk to her .	1
I'm not that high .	1
No luck ?	6, 7
You can still climb in that kiddie car and take a hike ... unless you can fight better than you can drive !	8, 1, 7
I appreciate what you're doing , [PERSON] .	8
I'm taking over the [LOCATION] office .	2
What if [PERSON]'s not gone ?	2, 5
I know how to listen , if that's what you mean .	1
He's good - looking .	5
I sure wouldn't do math unless I had to .	1
What if we had dinner ?	5
There was this one time , it was just me and of these ferocious , mouse - eating dingoes .	2
Yeah . Just call me . - When ?	2
Let him .	1, 2
There is no evidence .	1
I don't want to see them .	3
I really love her and she likes me .	5, 6
I'm working on a plan to get your case reviewed .	8
As you say , a foolish article .	3
Finally lifted the spell !	5
If [PERSON] found out , it would kill her .	6
No , let's not risk it . OK .	4
You really should be AM and FM ...	6, 7
You have absolutely no reason to be afraid of the King .	8, 2, 7
I know you drink on the quiet , and I know how much you drink .	3
But my shirt is wet .	1
You can't do this to him , or to all the others .	4
If you print anything now , I'll be exposed .	4
I'm the funny one .	8, 5
Will you be joining us , Mr. [PERSON] ?	2
He's a good man .	5
Looks like it's gonna be a long night .	6
This line of questioning doesn't seem particularly relevant .	1
I parked it in ... in a parking lot and I just ... I forgot where I parked it .	4, 6
Everything's gonna be all right .	8
The first person who's nice to us is another out - of - towner .	7
Schizo , I wanted to meet him ...	2, 6
They won't go .	3
I can't do this anymore .	6
That's great , eh ?	5
There are some in leadership whose time has come and gone . Look ...	3, 6, 7
He - e-e-ere's Daddy !	2
Hi , honey .	8, 5
Hey , trust me with your life but not your money or your wife . You're an asshole !	1, 3
Not very hard , then .	7
Whenever I'm petrified , I either cry or sing .	4
How long will you be able to keep the litigation going on your own resources ?	1
I'm going to jump .	6
That's terrible !	4, 7
You never gonna get married ?	7
No , Mr. [PERSON] , please don't call ...	4
You know how it is .	8
$ million , man .	5
You won't get my approval on this .	1, 3
But I don't give up so easily .	1
You've gone out of your mind .	1
If they track you down , it wouldn't be our doing .	4
He went ' bang ' !	7
Well , I don't know whether I can believe all this .	4
Thirty years in this fucking office .	1
Your plastic's not gonna help you now , you lousy little fuck .	1, 3
Skepticism is very healthy .	8
Yes , I was always afraid as a child .	6
As much as I would regret saving his .	1
Get me out of here .	4

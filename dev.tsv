I roll with him all the time , and he rolled with us on that move .	8
I'm not gonna sit here and be accused of things without any evidence !	1
You never used to drink it straight like that .	7
There is a question as to what kind of society we're going to be , whether we're going to tolerate sexual trafficking in children .	4, 6
More chanting ! Father !	2, 5
Now we're even .	8, 3, 5
Well , we'll figure something out .	8
The [PERSON] woman died today .	6
Uh , [PERSON] ? Here .	8, 2
You run a taut ship .	3, 4
Let me handle your husband's career and you can live like human beings again .	3
[PERSON] , it's so good to have you around .	5
And with the telling , it became easier .	5
I guess we're all trying to prove something to ourselves .	6
We didn't have a mortgage .	6
They say it is the skin of a dead snake .	3
Call me , okay ?	4, 5
I had the most frightening experience .	4
Look , we don't need him .	3
We didn't win because [PERSON] has video of [PERSON] in their offices .	1
You listen to me .	1
Somebody told me they thought he'd killed a man once .	4
Turn him off .	1, 2
It made me Mink about all of us being together again and how we used to be .	6
That explains why they didn't rape me right off .	4
I read it in a report this morning and ...	6
I'd want to pay you both .	8
I'm supposed to be your partner here .	1
You know , he's ... he's been so kind to me .	8
He'll never leave [LOCATION] . Then let him stay .	1
She's down .	6
I've lost another man and that bastard thinks it's funny .	3
Fantasia will be forgotten .	6
You dirty rat .	1, 3
Is she the one in the painting ?	7
They gave me a piece of candy in the store .	5
Brought about by what is know as  the miracle of love  .	5
You might be able to find something out there alone .	8
A whale can stave in the ribs of the biggest ships , swallow whole crews , pick its teeth with the oars .	4
Looking for [PERSON] ?	2, 5
Good job , good job .	5
We were thinking of getting engaged anyway .	2
Power is on its way .	8, 2
One two three !	5
How could you let her do a thing like this ? What ?	2, 7
Wait till my mates get you .	4
Like [PERSON] lost control ?	7
That's a good touch . Have the kid leave .  	5
Are you telling me not to worry but free the lab when you work everything out ?	1
How did you know my name ?	7
This bloody sod accused me of stealing me mate's grub .	1
They have no husbands and they cry .	6
You expect us to stand all the way ?	1
There's gas coming out of the wing .	4
He didn't know ...	6
He's after me .	4, 6
Yes . Take care now .	8, 2
I do not count , only King account .	2
He's mine !	5
Hey , I'm sorry about upstairs but I do see your pretty face and I just had to kiss it .	4
Now , let's get back to our examination . Shall we ?	1
Careful , brother .	4
If it's more important than golf , go ahead .	2
It's very pretty .	5
Looking forward to it , I might say .	2
This girl's been in an accident , [PERSON] .	4
She knows , wanted , of certainty that this cushion is wet .	8
You made the spell and you can undo it !	1
It seems there's no formal contract between you and [LOCATION] .	6
When I'm and you're still the way you are ?	3
He objects , she sustains , every time . The old flame's still burning , huh ?	7
I'm relaxed .	5
[PERSON] says very nice things about you in her letters .	5
♪ Got a whale of a tale to tell you , boys ♪	2, 5
Why were his fingerprints all over that goddamn glass ?	1, 3
Dear Mr. [PERSON] .   This is about a deputy prosecuting attorney who is taking bribes .  	6, 7
I'll take care of him .	8, 5
He takes good care of that .	8
Let the boy come in , [PERSON] .	8
I know old [PERSON] .	8
What a charming idea for [LOCATION] to surprise us with a lady comrade .	7
You're passing up the whitest man on earth for a dirty , no - good ...	3
You look tired , Little Big Man .	6
Something funny happened this morning at the store .	5
Shall I open a vein and sign it in blood ?	3
Want to take a look ?	8
She's won and I've lost .	6
I'm a little bit frightened .	4
You're still in love with her .	8
Left !	1
What the hell are you trying to do to me ?	1
I'd like to see Nurse Lt. [PERSON] .	2
For you to become a murderer ?	3, 6, 7
It's all I've got left .	6
They'd never approve of that being released .	4
And you know what ? They offered us a job .	7
I can't wait . Heh heh .	2, 5
How gorgeous !	5
I am innocent !	8, 6, 7
I don't dance well .	6
Let's take a walk .	2
Hey , [PERSON] , you going to the convention tomorrow ?	2
Or you can go straight back to your home on the streets .	3
The Delta [PERSON] house is having a party tonight , and you are cordially invited .	2
The reality however is much different .	4
It's ... it's gonna take me a while to map out all of her movements .	8
Thank you for letting me trespass .	8
We weren't thinking of going quite that far with it .	7
No , you wouldn't .	7
Don't you understand ?	1, 4, 7
gonna get another one ?	2
Take your hands off there , you old fool .	3
Come on now , let's go home .	8
I'll be there .	8
It's difficult holding her .	4
Someday the revolution will come and we can overthrow our leader .	2
Good night , [PERSON] .	8
Those men hadn't even thought of that .	7
Ahem . Father brophy was very disturbed .	1, 6
The captain has an honest face too .	8
The train is so stupid .	3
I am far more powerful than you can ever imagine .	8, 1, 2
Oh yeah ? You wan na tell me why ?	1
The sunsets were pink ...	4
How good to see you !	5
I've been doing some checking on you , Mr. [PERSON] .	4, 7
I can't believe that .	7
Don't you ever sleep ?	7
One of these days , I'm gonna spend me the rest of my life in one of these hot ...	2
Me and you are alive .	8, 5
I think you've solved the problem .	8
It's going to be a disaster .	4, 6
The police would know what to do .	8
Anything that man tells me will be a lie .	3
Do you think I do ?	1
I deeded him the land and he guaranteed me half of what he got if he made the sale .	8
I haven't even told my wife yet . You haven't ?	4
We'll go together .	2
I believe in your sweat .	8
Well , what's there to talk about ?	1
No she didn't . - Did you kill her ?	1, 6
Leader , party just got bigger .	7
Now let him win it back !	7
You'll not take her while I live !	1
Please come . Please come .	6
Like one time , I was with this guy and he came into my bedroom and he was naked , except he still had his socks on .	7
Wouldn't you say that prison is my fate ?	4, 6
And that's all I can give you .	6
You lose the feel of the cards when you have so much action ... day in and day out .	6
They let you in again ?	3
Because we've lived through it .	1, 5
After all she done ?	6, 7
Sure .	8, 5
Because we belong together .	8, 2
Better you than your mother .	3
That's a twist . - Oh , a fruit twist ?	7
Arguing's pretty much in my blood .	6
Look , is there someplace that we could go and talk ?	8
You and [PERSON] are a couple of sluts .	3
Is not it so ?	3
I cast thee back to hell !	1
Now , by my watch , does not mean in the morning , but : .	1, 3
Uncle [PERSON] ?	7
Keep your voice down !	1
This is my first night being a dad .	2, 4, 5
I don't want to be sent into that foreign atmosphere again .	4
Escape is impossible .	4
That was lovely .	5
You'll never deceive the people again !	1
let's drink to , uh , making new friends .	8
The man ends up looking like his heart attacked him .	6
You're staying here till the real law comes .	1
But I promise you that it will be the biggest innovation in the history of this business .	2
Background , [PERSON] . Tell me about it .	8, 2
Your Majesty , being inside of your confidence ... is the greatest joy I've ever known .	5
Come say hello to [PERSON] . Have you met ?	2
Why do you wear that rug ?	3
That's not true .	1, 4
Anyway the orders promoting him to Detective , First Grade , have already been cut .	6
Well , too much TV is bad for my ears .	1, 3, 6
All right . Set up a meeting . I'll hear them all out .	2
I'm the first to go .	1
I didn't see him again for five years .	6
Oh , just things that little girls dream about .	3, 6, 7
[PERSON] , please . Help .	8, 4
He hates everybody .	1, 3
[PERSON] ! Murderer !	4, 7
Yeah , she's wonderful .	5
I've had a very trying evening .	6
Just one ?	7
And that we have an uncorrupted scientific establishment , which we do not and which we will prove .	6, 7
He never wanted me .	6
Um , really good to see you , ma'am .	4
Listen , I know why you've come .	2, 4
Get up !	1
The idiot had his TV turned up , and I didn't --	1, 3
[PERSON]'s tapes encrypted , bounced by satellite to [LOCATION] , then decrypted - all in minutes .	8, 7
It's a shame to waste all that prime beef on a guy serving three to five in prison .	3
We've lost our picture .	6
I never thought I'd find myself in that crowd .	6
One more scratch on it and your career in the Navy is ended .	1, 2, 3
Come on . Stop complaining .	1
All right , what is it if I may ask , You do want to do ?	1
Now what makes you think I hate her ?	7
That people would go and do that !	1, 3
The next day I call [PERSON] .	2
Oh my God ! You totally should .	5
It's wasted on this bunch of Swiss bankers .	3
It may be the only way to unite us in this incredibly divided world of ours .	2, 5
I'm sorry , ma'am , but you're needed in the Situation Room .	7
I might not get you back this time .	6
That was my low .	6
Is it unfair ?	1
You intend to take it yourself ?	7
I can't start the car .	6, 7
I don't care if you fire me this exact fucking moment .	1
Most of their wounds won't heal properly .	4
Press down on her !	1
Why didn't you tell me ?	6, 7
You want to know the ... What do you call it ? Motivation ?	2
Look , I don't mind if you have a new dog but you can't let him run aroud scaring half the neighbourhood .	3
Don't move !	1, 2, 4, 7
And people do the strangest things , too .	7
Come , my child .	8
They hold together and bring me bad luck .	6
The usual , sir ?	8, 5
You've put us all in danger for your love of this woman .	1
My grandparents were killed in the war .	6
Come on , it's Christmas .	1, 2, 5, 6
And you were right there !	7
She wants to talk to me ?	7
There's some action at a place in [LOCATION] .	2
You got a minute , man ?	2
Um ... I'm always getting myself into these kinds of things .	7
I know you're crazy about me .	5
Is it , perhaps , that this cause is too hopeless ?	4
I'm not on the pills so we use rubbers , so it's hurting .	8, 1, 4, 6
Sweet musical [PERSON] , that's your friend ?	1
Fantastic .	5
What is ...	2, 4, 7
Heavens ' name !	7
[PERSON] , fuck off !	1
They must have wonderful materials to make a thing like this .	5
I mean , [PERSON] would always stick a matchbook under one leg to remind me that I'd measured wrong , but she never got rid of it .	1, 5
No time to be shy , ladies .	2
Won it in a stud game .	5
NOW !	1
An honorary stooge like me against the Taylors and Paines , the machines and the lies .	3
It's too late to start anything now .	4
I'm a sick man .	6
You can do it !	8, 5
We know from our fancy telescopes that just in the last years , more than planets have been identified outside our solar system that seem to be far enough from their suns and dense enough that they might be able to support	8, 2, 7
Who is there ?	4
And do remember me kindly to your charming wife .	8
You're in enough trouble as it is .	4
Don't kick me , I won't shut up .	1
I just spoke to [PERSON] .	5
I have wonderful news for you .	5
Gee whiz , so many things happening all at once .	4
I don't want any of that slop .	3
got a strong back . And a strong desire to escape .	8, 2
Come on , honey .	1
What you fail to understand ... is the power of hate .	1, 2
He swears he has no idea where [PERSON] is , but his phone records tell a different story .	3
You put asses into seats .	1
Don't be nervous .	8
You can't go !	1
I'm ready .	2
I suppose like the fathead you are , you told Father all your little hopes and dreams ?	3
I ain't giving you shit . I said I'd play you even , I play you even .	1
Don't go to him in anger . Go and warn him .	2
I'm sure you'll be happy with [PERSON] .	2
No , but he's not feeling well .	6
I'm getting off at the next stop . That's impossible .	2
He's been recorded saying ...	2
You'll need more than just two of us .	8, 1
This is a bullshit case .	1
There's a lot of things she could ask me but she won't say one darn word .	1
Maybe we've forgotten how to hope .	6
By stepping on a bottle and breaking the heel of my shoe !	1
Hello , sweetheart !	5
Would you like to go out to grab a burger and then go to the movies or something ?	2
Don't try and tell me the runway's too short .	1
I hate to do this , but I think we better get him to a hospital .	4
Shall we , eh , have a look at again ?	2
The agricultural use is one of the exceptions , fortunately .	5
Look . I've been kicking ass and taking names , trying to save your fucking hide .	1
He is my friend .	5
[PERSON] , you want a laugh ?	5
I have to warn the Soviets in the clearest possible terms that they risk taking us to the brink of an armed confrontation with incalculable consequences for all mankind .	4
Nobody knows anything about what's happening here .	7
What is this guy , nice or something ?	3
Weren't you , in fact , intimate with the lady ?	1, 6
Carlo would love to say hello !	2
It is of no concern to me	3
I'm not resigning my senior partnership the day after what happened , happened , if that's what you're asking .	2
And it's like she wants to be my mentor , which is exactly what I needed .	8
Um , should I wait for you ? No , no .	7
I like it !	5
[PERSON] , I'm gonna kill you , you murdering son of a bitch !	3
Copycat !	1
You bloody liar !	1
His skin . Like a bone or a tendon .	3
We can do better than that .	1
It couldn't have been me , sir .	4
This must be difficult , your life changing so drastically .	6
Look at that !	5
I don't want to hear another word .	1
We're here to have fun .	2
A drink comes in pretty handy sometimes .	5
If you need me , just pull this .	8
It means you become their slave hours a day seven days a week .	1, 3
[PERSON]'s gonna kill me , [PERSON] .	4
You have to focus on the road .	8, 5
You wouldn't want me to go in with a blunt scalpel .	5
That's the only chance you got left .	6
And I know this planet is safer because she's defending it .	8
And I appreciate it , [PERSON] .	5
You and [PERSON] use to play when you were children ?	2
Here's good news for you bachelors .	5
Their privilege , their presumption .	6, 7
You only pretended to be my friend .	6
Are you still mad about [LOCATION] ?	7
They gonna be full up , from what I hear .	2
Clang had the whole temple transported here for your sacrifice .	1
Are you in here ? Yes !	8
This is history .	6
How do you know ?	4, 7
I'm not available .	1, 3
What a shithole .	3
Ma damn foot's caught in the door !	1
Let go , you asshole !	1
He asked you not to get those records ?	1
Well , that's it for another day .	5
It was just like old times .	5, 6
This is the miracle I wanted .	5
He's worse than [PERSON] Tex.	3
Man , he is a lot bigger .	7
They come from the New Orleans Bridge Club ... and they've been bonded by the steward .	4
You're better .	5
Cold or not , it's good to be back in [LOCATION] .	5
Let's do some good .	2
You shut up , Dude , and listen to me .	1
What a glorious day it was .	5
You admire the son of a bitch .	8, 5, 7
A lot of you incumbents will be in danger of losing your seats .	1
My gang !	8
Captain ...	4
These are the wrong keys .	6, 7
You know , compadre ?	8, 5
You're becoming an important man , [PERSON] .	8
You had me scared for a minute .	4
What are we going to do ?	4
You're the little guy that tried to make off with my queen .	3
She's gonna kill him , [PERSON] .	4
We've got ta get the kids !	4
Why isn't he traveling with you ?	7
If that horse would run tomorrow ,	2
Oh , thank God .	5
Don't even breathe !	1
I love my country .	8, 5
Been dead over hours .	6
Good .	8, 5
So , fuck it . I figure I've got to straighten him out a little bit .	1
I've told you that he is what other men are not .	8, 5
Give them a taste of their own iron !	1
So we know where to look .	2
Want me to pick out one for you , Dutch ?	8
I swear . I don't know where you get it from . But you !	1
Sent what ?	4
I didn't expect to be called to see the admiral , sir .	7
Will you please tell me how you knew that ?	7
Some gang of cutthroats and murderers .	4
Which items ?	7
You sit down and pull up your pants and where would it get you ?	3
You hate guys like me , don't you ?	3, 4, 6
Hey . What the hell was that ?	1, 3, 7
How'd you like to have [PERSON] for a mother ? Or [PERSON] ?	5
The hearth lighted in the room to summer way , [PERSON] ?	5
Running up stairs keeps my legs slim .	5
It's a better world , we're all bound for .	8, 2
Of course .	8, 1, 2, 5
You don't know how much satisfaction it's been to me .	5
Mrs. [PERSON] , this is your wake - up call .	2, 4, 6
You can't take the life of another human being and get away with it !	3
Just grow up and go to sleep .	3
They might have a hundred guns , but it's safer down here !	2, 5
I would like you to meet a few of the exhibits here on the platform .	2
It takes away the pain .	6
Please . Look , this is ridiculous . You do not have to apologize .	2, 4
You've never known .	6
It's like having a beast ... wild within me ,	3, 4
A man dropped you off unconscious . Who ?	4
I wiped the fingerprints , do not worry .	8
Sign it !	2
Not exactly .	6, 7
Are you saying he's dead ? Not lying down dead , my friend .	2, 4
Or a wolf ?	6
I'm so bored with this face .	3
Someone will take care of you right away .	8
We were drilled like little soldiers .	6
We've run into a fog system not previously reported .	4
Can he present to proof D  ? 	2
Shoddy work will not do .	3
Don't you want to go to [LOCATION] ?	7
Kiss my ass .	1
Now , we must act immediately .	2
I'm not interested in your opinion .	1
God , we got a single shooter , southeast tower .	4
We come from a good family My name is Windy	2, 5
If I didn't love these boys so much , I think I'd kill them myself .	3
Do you question my word ?	1
When you can see into this crystal , then you will be ready .	8
Bloody woman .	1
I don't like this , any of it .	4
So you're going to report sister [PERSON] to the police ?	4
Keep [PERSON] away from anything that smacks of politics .	3
It'll be lovely .	2
It's terribly expensive here , [PERSON] .	3
This is the largest police car I've ever seen .	7
Rocky , I don't wan na make sandwiches .	1, 2, 4, 6
That surprises me .	7
Take your hands off me !	1
Remember , when you invited me ?	7
Everything okay ?	5
That's out of our jurisdiction , isn't it ?	3
I'll kill him and his bloody beast .	1
You've finished the whole investigation ?	7
Can we track the grandmother's cell ?	2
I'm just an old farm boy .	6
Well , look who's here .	7
I guess that's for me to know and you to find out , Detective [PERSON] !	2
Marry her !	2, 5
They'll kill us first .	4
From the moment you surrendered , you ceased to be soldiers .	3
I thought you'd be happy .	7
Hey , I'm looking to party , can you help me out ?	2
That's twice you've let me down , kid .	1
Why are you doing this to yourself ?	1, 3, 7
That is undoubtedly true .	8
I have something .	2
But it's bleeding ?	4
Who you trying to kid , sister ?	1
This guy's a phony , [PERSON] .	3
You'll make no calls .	1
Don't I know ?	7
Everything's so clean . Everybody's so nice .	8, 5
Is this one of your shenanigans ?	3
And if we could find it , it wouldn't have a tear .	1
Lousy .	3
Yep , glad to hear ... see you like music , too ?	2, 5, 7
He shouldn't have to decide here .	6
From any of those islands , he could launch a strike against [LOCATION] - [PERSON] .	4
Am I really good enough ?	4
I just meant he didn't care for me .	6
You can shoot us now .	6
You're blacking out , waking up in places you don't remember , bleeding from where you were shot .	6
What we have in mind has never been tried before .	2
You play , you pay .	1
I told you , this can get tough .	4
I was just gonna come see you .	2
Forgive me for not recognizing you , Dr. [PERSON] .	6
I am defeated .	6
Stop talking like a fool !	3
But with a nice sort of craziness .	5
!	1, 4, 7
How awful .	6
No , don't be silly .	8
I thought communications were out .	7
How many bullets does it hold ?	2
And let me remind you , we lost two key PA's in one day .	1
The damn insurance company won't cover you without a screen . I see .	1, 3
But there's something you may not know about us .	4
I may smack you around every once in a while , but I'm still your brother .	8
You don't see what's happening .	1
I shoulda listened to you .	6
With a baby , you never know what you're getting .	6
Here [PERSON] is .	5
I just can't keep doing this .	3, 4, 6
He knows no more than [PERSON] .	8
It could break us financially .	4, 6
I guess she's gone for good .	6
Shut up !	1
It's going to be all right , okay ?	8, 2, 5
Do you think you'd feel any better if I fixed you some toast and coffee ?	8
I think the least people could do is to say they're sorry , or ... something .	6
We've got nothing to wear . What about our habits ?	3, 6
It's great .	5
You talk treason and death .	3
We'll have a little surprise for you tonight .	2
One should be able to take care of one's possessions .	3
There's nothing I can do about it .	6
He should have been here by now .	4
These people want to disappear more than you do . They won't bother us .	8
I hate my life .	6
We can't feed the Russian people on your intentions .	1
You saved those men's lives .	5
Many hands went into creating [PERSON] .	5
I can pull it out and let you take a whip _ if you'd like .	2
This is a very sad day for me .	6
The X-rays will be along shortly .	8, 2
I'm glad you fellas happened along .	5
Are you able to offer something ?	2
In the end , we would be masters of a wrecked and hungry planet .	6
If I get the job , I'll buy you one hundred of 'em .	2
Who's talking about cowardice ?	3
He's taking the day off ?	7
... And I don't think we need to discuss the Trinity any more .	8, 1
Many of you aren't wearing battle gear .	6, 7
Blast off .	1
Mrs [PERSON] has fixed the grandest dinner .	5
We'll make it to [LOCATION] if you're not careful !	4
No , no , no , no , no , I want to know what the hell is happening to me !	1, 4
I said we're closed , [PERSON] .	1
Please , I'm begging you .	4
Nice entrance .	7
Our leaders are only good for parades .	3
Oh , [PERSON] , she was just great !	5
Meaning what , that I have no money ? - l don't know .	1, 4
Love you , too .	4, 6
I know what you're going to say .	2, 6
Time for the magic show .	2, 5
I don't give the orders , I obey them .	8
Shame on the people who put us in here !	1, 4
Now she's going back today , soon as we give 'em a full stomach to travel on .	5
Come on , man . I feel fucked up already .	1, 3, 6
He's enjoying it ! Can't you see he's enjoying it ?	5
Anyone who would deface a work of art with a color like that ought to have his ass removed .	1
( laughter ) woman :	4
Weren't your parents coming tonight ?	2
Idiot !	3
So are you , but I admit it openly .	1
MIT was after me , wanted me to rule the world for them .	1, 3
and on my wedding night , to wait for him with my heart full of love .	2
Aren't you supposed to know that ? Isn't that your job ? How could you be stupid enough to let somebody follow you ?	1
Now , be careful , children .	4
[PERSON] , [PERSON] , I'll tell you something .	4
Bye !	5
I carried you in here when you were a baby .	5
[PERSON] , I was so scared .	4
I'll be in the bar .	2
That's real fine .	5
See anything you like ?	2
Yeah , I bet she was a real beautiful girl before she met you .	3
Say , don't annoy me .	1

Can you , can you , can you , meet me , please .	2, 6
Ain't she seen a man before ?	7
All I can do is put you in tactical command of the operation .	8
Your whole story about how [PERSON] got his name on the door is bullshit !	1, 3
I like him .	5
I'm not asking permission !	1
Call the police .	4
You've got ten minutes to clear out .	1
Why isn't he at his desk ?	7
It's because you're so very grateful and always thank me so prettily .	8
I disagree .	6, 7
He's great if you happen to like a tall , blond , Prussian , Nordic , Aryan , Nazi type .	3
I made a deal with a cop once .	3
I was starting to miss the old [PERSON] , and now this has happened , and it just ... It feels ... it feels so final , you know ?	6
It's wonderful to have you back .	5
In this world full of hatred a man who knows that one rule has a great trust .	8
Anyone in your vicinity is in danger .	4

Thank you for my victories and for my defeats .	8
The choices I made .	1
Are you suggesting that I killed those women ?	4
[LOCATION] and Junior have been kidnapped .	4, 6
Don't try to change the subject .	1
Or are you lying ?	3
He's being evasive again .	1
I want those two guys banished from her life .	1
[PERSON] , your mother and I have brought you to this spot to share this last private ... This moment of ... Grief and pain .	6
When you get hurt , yell .	4
I'm expecting great things from you .	2
I don't know much about him , but I'd say he has good taste .	5
Sir [PERSON] wants his money , fast !	1, 4
Now I've really lost her .	6
Hey , would you like a-a flabellina oculina ?	2
I hate when you use the word  superfluous  .	3
How come I never see you eating ?	7
Now , my five ordinary senses , what with alcohol and other forms of abuse , are nothing special , but I have a sixth sense that any witch in the world would give her left broomstick to have .	5
Nothin' man . Whatever .	1, 3
I gave him my compartment . He only had coach seats .	5
This prick's been cheating the whole game .	1, 3
Look at what you've done .	1
I just came over to share my happiness with you , [PERSON] .	5
Merry Christmas .	5
How'd you find us ?	7
[PERSON] , most can barely walk .	4
I feel sorry .	6
But if [PERSON]'s an angel , why ain't he in Heaven ?	3, 4, 6, 7
We expect the best from you .	2
Help us please !	4
Of course , but we are only telling you because we know you'll want to rescue him .	2, 4
Not now , [PERSON] , I'm busy !	1, 2, 3
Now that particular statement really pissed me off , because I don't think Congress did any such thing .	1, 3
[PERSON] was so excited about your coming .	5
I have a condo with a pool .	5
[PERSON] was a good cop .	8
You feel better , [PERSON] ?	5
This is one sophisticated operation .	8, 7
I just went to sleep , woke up feeling fine , remembered everything .	5
This is a risk we dare not ignore .	4
There's nothing else I can do .	6
This is for life .	8, 5
Consuella is right .	8
Anyway , these are the things that was taught to me and , if you want , I'd like to teach to you .	8, 2, 5
Yeah , we got unfinished business ! Her and me .	1
This sure is a happy day to me .	5
You know I'm gonna be the president , right ?	1
Boy , you amaze me .	7
I thought you were a confirmed private .	7
I'm gonna straighten you out once and for all !	1
You've got a beard ! You're a man !	7
That's what foxes me .	1
Get out of my way !	1
It's a train robbery .	4
The cops are all over the place .	4
If that's true , we were guilty .	2, 4, 6
Remind me to ask you later why your kisses don't seem quite the same .	6
I want them to tell [PERSON] that [PERSON] is dirty .	2
Get away from that wood !	1
You can see that they are jealous .	5
Oh , I'm awfully sorry , everybody .	6
Sorry . - Sorry to wake you .	6
Get ready to grab the son of a gun .	2
Have you a sales force , or are you still relying on divine intervention ?	1, 3
I'm gonna kill myself .	6
Thanks .	8, 5
Isn't that wonderful , father ?	5
Boss , you think of everything .	8
You wicked boy .	1
His Majesty is very demanding .	1, 7
Well , how do you think that I make ends meet with your father Gallivanting off to [LOCATION] ?	1
I know he was your friend .	8
Inclined to hound subordinates about small details ?	1, 2
No , she's calling your home .	1
What the hell ?	1, 7
Get in .	3
Listen , I've had just about enough of your comedy , clown .	1
The only reasonable explanation is a germ , a bacteria or a virus , that has a mind - altering effect .	4, 6
I tormented you with an old hatred that's no longer real .	6
Here there's a roof over your head Might as well stay here	8, 2
They probably will start crying .	6
She'll lend you an air of respectability if that's possible .	3
You need a hand with those ?	8
She said I stabbed that son of a bitch plenty of times . 	1
You are everything I would want as my wife .	8, 5
I've got this town wired .	8
If this baby comes your way , look out !	1, 2
We're not gonna forfeit .	1, 2
I got ta stop that fool .	3
Don't you worry about [PERSON] . He can handle himself .	8
There are definitely people who feel like it's your fault .	1
We miss one payment , and you can foreclose ?	7
How about update tomorrow ?	2
What does that mean ?	1, 2, 4
This year , it's gonna be different .	2
Can't I have everything ?	7
See ? See ? See ?	1, 2
It means I haven't forgotten whose court I'm on .	1
It was good therapy after my divorce and my miscarriages .	8
My own husband was killed in this last war .	6
Nobody gives a shit , believe me !	1
It would adore . [PERSON] , [PERSON] , come to my office a moment .	5
They said I was crazy , so they sent me to a mental hospital .	6
And at the end of the happy day he is slaughtered jolly with a knife .	2, 4, 7
My career will be ruined .	4
You got ta settle down or you're gonna wake him up .	8, 6, 7
Boys forget what their country means by just reading  Land of the Free  in history books .	6
I'm sure I can do it .	5
Nothing doing .	3
The trouble is , a lot of highly paid favourite sons are in danger of having their rice bowls broken and going hungry , all on account of these goddamn notebooks .	1, 4
Can you tell me where the [LOCATION] [LOCATION] is ?	2
You dare hold your queen up to ridicule ?	3
Don't let that cop get away with this .	1, 3
OK , take me there .	2
Oh , you little beauty !	5
I'll tell [PERSON] I'm engaged to [PERSON] .	2
The Feds are at the lake house , man .	1
I see six sides to every risk and reasons not to take it .	4
[PERSON] , I don't know what I'll do when you go .	4
The back door !	7
I don't know ... Maybe the batteries are dead .	4
You are going to get us all killed If you keep on antagonizing him .	6, 7
I think that people would stop looking at each other with a certain level of hostility , like , we do now .	6
Oh , yeah .	8
Do you want to be a truck driver again ?	1
That would be nice .	8, 5
You're much too smart , aren't you ?	3
[PERSON] . Thank you .	5
Oh , shit !	4
Where are they taking you ?	2
That !	7
Even in one of yours , I would have thrown this glass at him .	1
The bite ... was mine .	6, 7
Would you repeat it in court ?	8
Why do you think there's been no fighting in [PERSON] or [PERSON] ?	2
Why is there a statue of a husky ?	7
I can see that !	7
What you have done ?	1, 6
King [PERSON] says not only do I have to kill you ,	4
Don't call me .	1
Guess my old man's not such a bad guy after all .	8
I'll tear you apart !	1
And Shooter , Lady Fingers and me just carried them right here .	8
And when you win Oscars , both of you , you'll look in the camera and thank me .	2
This should impress the bankers .	2
Well , that's as good a way to go through life as any other , isn't it ?	5
She's never cared for me .	6
Have fun , sweetie ?	5
Boys , sweep them out of the gutter .	3
You'd better tell your friends , too .	1
You think I was born yesterday ?	1
Boy , that'll be something .	2
Rakonin has just given me the most amazing news .	7
For these and all my sins of my past life , I am heartily sorry .	6
[PERSON] in office can cause damage .	6
They're all dead .	6
I don't care what she looks like . I don't like the company she keeps .	3
% ? !	7
Emergency speed , all engines !	4
Why , what is the matter with you ?	1
You're gonna be outta work , you keep scamming like you are .	3
Mind your own business , would you ?	1
You won't cheat [PERSON] out of publicly ordering you out of her house .	1
And you shouldn't neglect your gums .	7
He disappeared a long time ago .	6
I'll be surprised . What about years ?	7
That ought to teach those [LOCATION] to stay away from my house .	3
Yeah , I just wanted to talk to you .	8, 2
What are you doing in here ?	7
Sick dog , what's his name ?	2
Forget it .	1, 6
Crazy out of your skull .	3
So , you're a lawyer now ?	7
Such a beautiful bride .	5
Do you have a boyfriend ?	2, 6, 7
You know , now that we're alone , there's ... There's something that I've been wanting to ask you .	4
I'm glad you liked it .	5
[PERSON] says you guessed the strategy months ago .	2
If you accept the bouncer dimensional theory , it's highly likely that we've done a hell of a lot of damage .	2, 4
Or perhaps you should be careful .	4
All units , be advised .	8
Ok , kids , dinner's almost ready ! Turn off the TV !	1
On board the flagship I told him the log didn't justify such action . - - And that we'd be charged with mutiny .	1, 3
That's too much gun for a man to have just for shooting rabbits .	1
Duck !	7
Mr. [PERSON] ?	2
No , I don't love you .	6
Sit down there .	8
Take a look at these wrinkles and these here grey hairs .	3
This lovely young lady shall hold this object signifying nothing .	8
I was amazed at his violent reaction until the evidence came to me that he owned those very 200 , acres .	7
She's lovely .	8, 5
She's dying .	6
If we let him live , could he forgive us ?	4
They're armed .	2, 4
I got faith in you .	8
And now they need a new one .	2
Are you happy now , yeah ?	1
I mean , all you have to do is to step aside with immense fortune .	8
You are strong .	8
This is junk .	3
[PERSON] , that was your new partner .	6, 7
But I don't think you have to worry about this one .	8
You'll just have time to change .	1
She ... She does not speak for the rest of us , Mr. [PERSON] .	4
Call me as soon as you find it out .	2
That was close .	7
This greaser was just trying to tell me how to run my business .	3
We don't commit murder up here .	3
Got a guest , fam !	2, 5, 7
At bottom she's a very dull girl and the life she pictures for herself is the life she belongs in .	3
Removed ?	4
Unfortunately , I have to return to my children now .	6
Fine . Actually , perfect .	1
Look at it again , professor .	1
It's too risky .	4
Don't touch me unless you love me .	3
It's nice to see you again .	5
And I'll tell you all about that job .	2
Do you know what kind of car we have , isaac ?	2
One can't expect bloody Yanks to understand .	1, 3
You can depend on me for an additional overcall of 250 .	8
I suggest you keep that promise .	1, 2, 6
Be well , [PERSON] .	2
How did we end up talking about your death from my drug test ? I don't understand .	6
Yes , son , I'm afraid .	4
It wasn't up to my mother .	1, 6
And one step further from prison .	8, 2, 5
[PERSON]'s bugging me .	1, 3
But and the Duchess ?	2, 7
Altitude !	1
Where've you been ?	1, 2, 7
You're lyin' !	3
You can be famous .	2
You've got to stop !	1, 4
Running away ? - Don't look for trouble , [PERSON] .	1
I wouldn't trust you to lick a stamp !	3
Since he found out we're behind it , he's been running us ragged .	4
You're not thinking what I think you're thinking , are you ?	8, 2, 4, 7
When you're around , Ma , nothing can stop me .	8
I feel useless because I was born without it .	6
I did not ask your advice .	1
Reel her in . Steady .	2
I mean , it was rather unprofessional on her part .	1, 3
I have no basis and no standing to move forward if I did .	4, 6
They really do know where I'm hiding , [PERSON] ?	4
Thanks . - Thank you . - Both of you .	5
Fuck your goddamn cleaner !	1
You got it .	8, 5
They make me .	4
[PERSON] , get a load of this .	2
That was fun .	5
Your sins are forgiven , my child .	8, 5
The more you hear about this and the increased incidents of sex trafficking , the more Backpage comes up .	3, 6
[PERSON] ! - He was right about the motel .	8
I'm sorry .	1, 3, 4, 6, 8
No complaints , you're reliable -	8
Ah , [PERSON] , old chum .	7
Well , [PERSON] will think of something .	8
It'll probably kill me , too .	4
She never cared about me !	1
She do that to make him crazy so he don't know what he doing .	3
Let's put him on the payroll .	1
Why is she still walking around ?	1
You tell him to take care of you .	8
I've got bad news for you , GJ .	6
Now , if you will just give me the name and the address of the person .	8
We'll just go and have a great time anyway , huh ?	5
Did you ?	7
She said she would .	8
Remember my th birthday party when you lifted your skirt up ...	5
And for [PERSON] .	8
No , [PERSON] .	6
There's a shitload of that .	7
I'll tell you later .	2
But the crisis is now , sir .	4

I'm in control .	8
This thing that's killing your people and mine is from the other side .	4
Smell that , [PERSON] ?	2

[PERSON] , listen to me .	6

She's got an indiscreet voice .	3
You write the long word on top of the page , and under it , you write all of the short words you can make out of the long one .	8, 2
They do not want to separate of you .	8
Very nice show , [PERSON] .	5
You remember this guy .	8, 2
Turn all of that administrative bullshit to Mac .	1
Don't leave me now .	4
After that pathetic scene in the parking lot , she is fucked and should resign .	3
Don't worry , he'll be along .	8
You wanted big ... real big .	2
You put your head in the sand .	1
You wan na help me make dinner ? - Uh , no !	1
Repeat , destroyers .	4
Now , you must fly out immediately !	2, 4

I just wan na feel better .	6
It must be in your genes .	5
What if an RD conks out ?	6
All right , then .	8, 5
Do you think I'd be grateful for an easy life when my friends are treated like animals ?	3
What ? [PERSON] has an exemplary record with the bureau .	1
Are you a fool or a mutineer ?	2, 3
So why don't you tell me a little about yourself ?	2
Otherwise , what good am I to them ?	6
Thank you , thank you , thank you ...	8
That's it !	1
You don't like to see me enjoying myself .	6
You can hold the frog .	8
We mean it , sir , all kiddin' aside .	8, 2, 5, 7
Motherfuckers !	1
I have heard that the King is ....	2
She puts the same information out there , Collects her paycheck , and somehow she sleeps at night .	3, 7
They'll beg us to let them in .	1
See you later .	2, 5
So now that you're a good guy , what about the bad guys ?	2
If you have a lawyer , it's a good time to call him .	8
So do not listen to anything	1
Everybody except me .	6
We've got the best soldiers in the German army here .	8
Please ... No ...	4
But he's dead .	6
I say this as a friend .	8
She gave you that ?	7
Awkward ass .	3
I would put money on us .	8, 2
I can't wait to see that [PERSON] .	2
How can we be absolutely sure the waste disposal is taken care of ?	4
Was the public in danger as a result of the accident ?	4
Don't you call my husband names !	1
What they do with the tapes is their own business .	1
It's just the beginning .	1, 5
He's in my dressing room .	2
Wipe that fucking smile off your face !	3
She's very unhappy .	6
Yes , sir .	8, 4
Do you want to come down and hang out or something ?	2
You're not getting anywhere , are you ?	1
Here they are in all their glory !	5
Oh , great news , I got some turkey burgers , you know we can grill , and watch a little Monday Night Raw tonight if you want ?	5
What are you talking about , dad ,	4, 6, 7
I might have been a lot of things , but I never was a tramp .	3
They screwed him up .	6
I don't make deals with peasants !	3
Who the hell is that ?	1
I'm sorry they don't like me .	6
Damn you !	1
Of course I wouldn't .	1
They both fell .	6
I can't tell you what a comfort that is .	5
I'll blacken this punk so he'll ...	3
I got my shotgun full of 16 , thin dimes .	1
So you can see [PERSON] is deep in trouble .	4
I think this is the greatest day I've ever spent .	5
Do you drink this stuff ? No .	2
You saying I got no brains ?	1
Besides , I have to go to the goddamn senior honours dinner tonight .	1
Everybody else thought it was funny !	7

You're too little and weak , like a girl .	3
Don't cry .	6
If you have any last words , say them now .	1
I did it , bro .	8
Drop that wood !	1
You're pretty enough to do other things .	5
But there's the challenge .	4
Aye , it might be the monster , all right !	4
He's got a shotgun on you , [PERSON] .	4
I told him my problem , I told him I loved you and he told me to keep my trap shut .	6
Son of dork , son of dork !	1
Then give me your home number .	1
We're seven minutes behind schedule .	1
Something terrible always happens when I go to a party .	4
It's a belt that makes its wearer invisible .	7
Will you look after [PERSON] for me ?	8
Hey , come on !	1, 2
It's a pleasure , I assure you , [PERSON] .	5
He was safe .	5
If I take the Fifth and refuse to testify before the grand jury ... It could destroy my reputation .	4
I don't mind it if you call me [PERSON] , you know .	7

Clear ?	1
Yeah !	5, 7
Mommy ...	6
I don't want any trouble .	4
I'm flying to [LOCATION] tonight , [PERSON] .	2
I can pay whatever you want .	8
He humiliated me !	1, 3, 6
I'm sure that in all [LOCATION] there's no empathicalist as charming as you .	5
I didn't like this boy to begin with , but no man that wasn't sincere could stage a fight like this against all odds .	3
Watch your ass , [PERSON] boy .	1
We're going airborne !	2
Sometimes cheap perfume can be very exciting .	5
No , it isn't . Just because we aren't expecting resistance , don't relax on this one .	4
[PERSON] , you're losing your family !	1, 4, 6
That's [PERSON]'s , he values that . He won it ! Good !	5, 7
Mitä nyt ? , [PERSON] , please .	1
Your ship's been in lots of battles .	8
Now isn't that jolly ?	5, 7
I can be a friend to you , you know .	2, 5
Oh , I'm fine .	2, 5
You naughty boys .	1, 3
Satan !	7
The Hundjager I killed was Verrat .	2, 5
Wait ... wait - wait ,	4
What could possibly be the matter ?	1
But a crime was committed here and I'm going after her for it .	1, 2
How about yourself ? - Cool .	2
That's very good .	5
Undoubtedly we can expect something soon .	2
Let's go and see my cousin .	2
Sit down .	1
Here ... the Revolution started .	5
I can't afford the wheels .	6
I don't know . We just ... became friends . And then it became more than that .	8, 5
I'm gonna take you to all the capitals of all the countries in the world .	2
Please , be careful .	4
I am going to throw up .	3
You stole them turnips from [PERSON] and it's the wrong time of the year for stealing .	3
Are my glasses there ? Eh ... no .	1
Well , I know a few of the guys .	5, 7
Let's get married .	2
Go on . Get the hell out of here .	1
If you don't give me my $ 200 , I'm going to tell a policeman how you got it and he'll make you give it to me , 'cause it's mine .	1
Not so bad , but there's dirty weather ahead .	4
You know , so it shouldn't fall apart in his hands .	8
I'm tired of being only three inches high .	6
I am not your horse .	6, 7
Acknowledging defeat is never easy .	6
This thing isn't here for decoration .	1
He was a [LOCATION] bus driver , and when I was a boy , he used to take me over the river to [LOCATION] , where the rich people lived .	8
You !	1, 3
It can't be so hard to die .	3
I don't know what it is	7
Father !	2, 5, 7
You still workin' on that deal ?	7
Hey , fuck off !	1
So it must have been important .	8
They told me you wouldn't see me .	7
But I didn't sleep yet .	7
It was just ... something happened that ... hasn't happened in like years .	4, 6, 7
I do not want to hear one more insubordinate word ... from anyone in this platoon .	3
Do you celebrate tonight ?	2
Shit happens .	3
In the summertime , at sunset , the whole beach looks incredible .	5
How many other generals can boast the favor and support of a leader ... so gifted in the arts of war ?	8
You're just like Grandma , always judging me .	1
I can wind this one up in six weeks .	5
[PERSON] knew his way around the old neighbourhoods .	8
And I was thinking more of sushi ?	7
Suppose they meet ?	4
Yeah , yeah , that's a really good idea , because if anybody does come here , it's just me and [PERSON] , and , you know , the little guy .	2
How did I get mixed up with a bum like him ?	3
It's my birthday . I thought I'd invite you for dinner .	2, 5
He ain't gonna make it .	4, 6
A fortunate young man .	5
It's very good .	5
All I could think of was that they were going to kill me .	4
How can you say such a thing ?	1
Then I think you need to see a doctor .	4
[PERSON] , didn't you go and bat for me ? It was the owner's call .	1
How about -- this cereal is really good .	7
I was very angry with him .	1
It's nice to meet you .	5
Let's not get carried away here .	7
I can't breathe !	4
Let's talk about something else .	3
What do you know ?	2
You leave that door open !	1
I'll get chocolate chip . Coming up .	2
You tell her .	1
You're the hero of the hour .	8
Or hunting . You prefer hunting ?	2
He didn't look well last night .	6
Am I wrong , Lady ?	8, 1, 2
Hey , what are you drawing there ?	2
I've got a plan .	2, 5
You said you loved me , I always love me .	5
Sometimes , in the middle of the night , I sit up and wonder where I am .	7
Miss [PERSON] , before anything else happens ,	4
Don't let anybody ever tell you different .	8, 5
Do you feel better now that you're eating ?	2
Either he falls in line or I'll break him so open they won't find the pieces .	1
Advise me of any further messages .	2
It looks ridiculous with that coat he's got on .	3
You sure come to the right place here .	8
Can I have my store back , now that she's going ?	1, 2
Will you shut up ?	1
That storm is pretty bad .	4
That's unacceptable .	1, 3
He's a prick .	1, 3
The figures I have just quoted indicate an efficiently run o .	8
I hope so .	4
There's nothing we can do about it .	4
We don't need you here !	1
You're not telling me everything .	1
You were right , a thousand percent right .	8
Look , I won !	5, 7
The cockroaches here are of the best quality	8
Murdering unarmed men ?	3
He's with them .	1
I think it was fun and sexy .	5
You are my last hope .	8
Really ashamed of myself .	6
I don't need you falling apart on me .	6
What are you doing ? ! - So long , guys .	7
I'm coming to you .	2
I think I still have the key .	2
They'll be behind these desks some day .	2
Therefore , it must be a metal .	4
My pleasure , sisters .	5
It gives me great pleasure to introduce to you , [PERSON] .	8, 5
You mind if I take my boots off ?	2
She stuck by my side when nobody else did .	8
You are doing very well .	8
Uh , I'm late for a meeting .	7
If I analyze military strategy , they say I'm planning a rebellion	1
What were you gonna say ?	2
I got a wife and a family I'm not with , [PERSON] ,	6
It hurts me when people laugh at you .	6
Or God knows in how many lifetimes you'll be paying for it .	4
Sorry , coach .	6
I hope you like it .	5
And there's this great Cézanne coming up for sale in a very messy divorce .	2
I guess this is my last season .	6
This is cool .	5
I told you to come left , and fast .	1
Now , you listen to me .	1
But you seem to go to [LOCATION] rather more than you come to [LOCATION] .	6, 7
She's got  champion  written all over her .	8
Lucky you .	5
Yes , we can . - How ?	2
It's all for show .	3
That's right , sister .	8
I do not hide the truth .	8
That monster is so tall , it'll see us if he stands up straight	2, 4, 7
Let's see if he's ticklish .	2
Those wicked detectives ...	1, 3
Like what ?	7
God took them because of my wicked thoughts ! No .	1, 4, 6
There won't be trouble from the dead .	1
These can be disposed of only by incapacitating the brain .	8, 4
Well , I never thought I'd see the day .	7
[PERSON] , I don't think it'd be so bad if I taught him how to throw a few ...	1
They are so dear both !	5
We've really got ta make tracks or we're dead ! C'mon !	4
It's for you .	8, 5
What's your dream ?	2, 5
It's all right . I'll have to bring our sledge . Hurry .	2, 5
Everybody forgot about it but me .	1, 3
I won't take it !	1
With a little left over for [PERSON] ?	2
No need to worry , son .	8
I'm just so scared .	4, 6
We ain't hungry ... not food hungry anyway .	2, 3, 4, 7
If [PERSON]'s a good boy , he gets the jackpot .	2, 5
What's the deal here ? You used to work here or something ?	1
I don't want to talk to him . I'll call him Monday .	1
You think of me as sort of a cross between your wife and your mother .	1
He's gonna kill her .	4
If you don't eat and sleep , you have to expect accidents like that .	6
Father , I've led such a sinful life .	4
Did you follow through of what we discussed ?	8, 2
Of course . That's it .	2, 5
I called him a liar .	1
I ran a make on that guy we've been seeing all over town . Turns out to be --	2
No more questions .	1
Hastings , we will leave this , up to the lawyer of the Mrs. [PERSON] to be present .	4
We'll have a whole factory .	2
You dress like this , you attract attention to me .	1, 3
You know , [PERSON] , I've just remembered I've got quite a lot of work to do tonight , so I think I'll be going .	3, 4, 6
Well , I don't think I'd wan na bet on it .	8
Monster ! He's hiding my [PERSON] !	3, 4
Did Mr. [PERSON] call anybody in the room by name ?	2
So , you guys are mounties ?	2, 7
Darling , it just doesn't make sense .	7
I got too messed up ' bro .	6
My life is none of your business .	1, 3
Junior !	2, 5
I'm taking over the bridge .	2, 5
You stay away from my baby .	1
And we know how to do that , don't we boy ?	8
We're not going to kick anyone out .	8
I'm coming down . -[PERSON] , don't start anything .	2
We're ready and waiting .	2
Sit ... down .	1, 3, 4
I've even ... Maybe you won't admit it , but you love me . - [PERSON] .	6
Home team !	2, 5
Look out !	4
Something that no one's ever done for him before .	5, 6
An acquaintance of mine stole classified documents from the NSA and took off to [LOCATION] .	6
Because it hurts my ears when you do it .	1
It ain't safe to go that way ...	4
I don't know anything about it .	4
What , somebody had a saxophone ?	7
His uncle helped to design the original lunar module that put the first men on the moon .	8
Of course they're armed and dangerous .	1
Well , [PERSON] , I'm gonna make you my deputy .	8
There can be ...	2
Maybe it'll take a few months , maybe a year .	2
Caught in the act .	7
I'd like your opinion .	8
And that's the one thing that can make Mr. [PERSON] fly all the way here from [LOCATION] .	2
I was only trying to be nice to make her feel good .	6
I told Mr [PERSON] ...	8
It doesn't make sense that you can sit and you can hear the testimony or , you can see all of the evidence and you can not feel a certain amount of responsibility to make things right .	1
What are you wearing my coat for ?	2, 7
In the first place , this young lady is under exclusive contract to Mr. [PERSON] , of course , and he can not discuss her future availability at this time .	2
I've been missing you a lot lately .	8, 5, 6
How I'd love to hit the jackpot .	2
I know him .	7
What are they doing here ?	7
You want to know what a real criminal is , [PERSON] ?	1
Lord [PERSON] ! Lord [PERSON] ! Lord [PERSON] !	7
Tell him you're not going , tomorrow morning or ever .	6
How do you expect to enjoy your honeymoon if you can't relax ?	1
Wow . - I missed that one .	3, 7
I don't want this !	7
You hear me ?	1
Now , Kid , what's your game ?	2
And you got a lovely face .	5
All right , boys and girls , come on out .	2, 5
Oh Mr. [PERSON] , everything ok ?	8
But he knew I was lying .	4
I was afraid of that .	4
You know how much I enjoy your high style of playing .	8, 2, 5
You'll be told after you sail .	1
Enjoy it .	8
Then , instruct [PERSON] to stay put with your younger brother .	1
I have something I'd like to show you .	2
We mustn't let a little thing like this ruin our evening .	2, 5
Don't be an idiot .	1, 3
He says that he's looking at a giant asshole from [LOCATION] .	3
But they turned the lights down this time and didn't say this is a drill .	4
Goodbye , Mom .	6
I'm glad I saw it before becoming extinct .	5
And I don't share my husband with anyone !	1
And dead ahead , is home sweet home .	8, 5, 6
Okay , we'll do it , but I want to hear [PERSON]'s voice , and I mean now .	1
We'll be OK .	8, 2, 5
When did that start ?	7
Then why don't you obey ?	1
Leave us alone .	4
And there's the black hand that did the dirty deed .	3
We've got to get the money in circulation before you'll get this country back to prosperity .	4
Oh I bet you do ... and then minutes later every cop in the state'd be after us .	1
What's wrong ?	2, 4, 5, 7, 8
You like the color , [PERSON] ?	2
We got a big problem .	4
[PERSON] , I can't make it so soon ...	3, 6
That was a good one .	5
Pecmans ? Buttissimo ? Ah , the old abba dabbas	8

They'll do everything that can be done .	8
Fingers crossed .	2
The dove was a ghost ?	7
I don't know . I don't know .	6, 7
You know , maybe it's better you're not staying here .	1
The press briefing room , [PERSON] , really ?	1, 2, 3, 7
We're going to have to go down there and calm everybody else .	8
You want us to believe that ?	7
I can't go to the grand jury without him .	4, 6
Come on ! Try it out .	8, 2
She went by taxi .	3
A very mean hand .	2
She's got a great body .	5
Do you want me to come with you ?	8
Poor [PERSON] .	6
Oh , you have tobacco !	7
I think it'll support us .	8
Ha ha ha ! This is it , [LOCATION] ! The event you've all been waiting for .	1
I'm gonna kill you .	1

Just look at me . I can't get through that jungle .	4
The Martians had calculated their descent with amazing perfection .	7

You keep avoiding me .	6
It's Nobel Prize juice . Set sail for home , for [LOCATION] !	5
At least they can dream .	5
Let me me go somewhere else . I'm sick .	6
In the dream , the destroyer's destroyed .	4
I don't pay you good money to have you jerk me around .	3
Is there something I can do for you ?	2
You must have had some wonderful experiences in [LOCATION] .	5
And that she's really worried about you .	8, 5
What the hell does that mean ?	1, 3
He knows you can do it , so do I.	8
Take that sentence back !	1
Men flirt with girls like that , but they don't marry them .	1
What do you say , cousin ?	2
You know , I never saw this episode .	5, 7
You see , [PERSON] , there are certain advantages to being on the sick list .	5
Well , I'm here to have a dialogue .	8, 2, 3
So you're figuring what ? The guy she was having cocktails with did her ?	3
What's up with you people and that watermelon ?	2, 3, 7
I mean , this is the Supreme Court .	1
They didn't miss me at all .	6
Well , I don't .	3
We've heard from Kennedy Approach that we've run into a traffic problem .	4
A horse - ranch Indian , a drunken gunfighter , a sex maniac ... and an uncle !	7
He blows it .	1, 4
Ma'am , she's no longer a minor . There's nothing we can do . But , but , but .	6
What time's your bus ?	2

She's an unlucky driver .	6
She has the name of a man .	7
I wondered if you'd do me a favour , if you ain't busy .	2
He owes me $ , and won't pay up .	1, 3, 7
You know what I'm asking .	1
Will you promise ?	8
Holy Moses .	7
We need you to know what work we'll give you .	8
Are you ready ?	2
Your mom and I won't be very long .	6

I don't need a doctor . I need a promoter .	1
If I can watch TV .	1

I wonder if there are any kites around here we can fly .	2
I've been sleeping with women .	5
And loyal to you , ma'am .	8
You sure this is the right address ?	7
It took some guts .	8
I don't want to hear it .	1
And every single one of those memories that you're so desperate to pry out of his damaged brain can turn him right back into it .	3, 4, 6
You know , you - you could get hurt . You shouldn't go around robbing people . You could go to jail .	1, 3, 4, 6

Did you spend every cent you ever made ?	3

Welcome to [LOCATION] !	2, 5
You think you're pretty smart , don't you ?	3
I've got every man on it , but without FBI or locals , we're carrying a handicap .	4
But there's no support for this appealing idea .	1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7
[PERSON] . [PERSON] , are you all right ?	4
He is an upwardly - mobile super-achiever and lives in a condo on [LOCATION] .	3

There's no escape .	6
Of course I'll help you .	8, 5
Do you think we'd better let it go at that ?	3
We can't wait for it .	2
Then why put up such a front ?	1
There's a face beneath this face . - No !	1, 4
I have an officer here for [PERSON] .	2
What a marvellous woman !	8, 5, 7

There was a group that helped criminals get guns so they could shoot citizens .	3
We'll have dinner at the St Regis , go to a nice snappy show , then to a nightclub , sit and listen to the soft music , and who knows ?	2
And just how did he go about that ?	7
We got 'em again !	1
If you can get to his phones , we'll have our leads .	2
She ought to be melted down for razor blades .	1, 3
Wait a minute !	1, 7
That was magical , that [PERSON] stuff .	5
Am I , [PERSON] ? - No .	3, 6, 7
I don't have to get any place but out . Share a cab ?	8, 2
What good is that gonna do if the people who run this government don't have access to the programs ?	1
We are going to explode ! All right . [PERSON] , .	4

You see , this'll be my very first own home .	2
Very loyal .	8
The margin for error is narrow here .	8
What do you know about this ?	1
Yes , I'm sure .	8, 5
So is it true that if you commit a sin out of fear it is not necessarily a sin after all ?	2, 4
Give me my clothes , please .	1
I don't have time .	6
He was my first lover .	8, 5
Now , I happen to know of a prick that's responsible for the whole fucking operation and that son of bitch is hurting out there , and I'm fucking liking it .	1, 3, 5
Next time , I'll wipe 'em on you .	1
Come over here and nobody gets hurt . OK , OK .	1, 2
I'm going now to the church for confession .	4, 6
Should we call him ?	2, 7
When the shooting starts , don't forget to duck .	4
You must tell me a few of them .	8
They do not know the hardships of the imperial court	3, 6
That's fabulous , really .	5, 7
I'm not doing it alone .	4, 6, 7
Which way is this train heading ?	4
She's empty .	7
Don't worry . Your secret is safe with me .	8
We were all a part of what happened to her .	6
She's not taking that .	7
And now I really need a drink .	2
The door swings both ways , my ass .	1
I Iove you , [PERSON] .	5
Do you want a beer or something ?	8
I guess that's why the old man gave it to you !	7
Never talk about [PERSON] .	1

They took his heart out .	3
None of this was [PERSON]'s fault .	7
Do it right away .	2
I'll give you two .	5
Why don't you shut the hell up ! Crybaby .	1, 3
Ace , king , .	5
The fashions this spring are very becoming to her .	5
So that at least narrows down where they are right now .	5
She has great elegance .	5
Let's stop wasting time .	8, 1, 2
Were you a guest ?	7
What an idiot .	1
That guy seems like a real piece of work .	3
How the hell did you know I didn't have the king or the ace ?	1, 7
You get out tomorrow !	1
[PERSON] , do you think people will see this video in [LOCATION] ?	2
What I want is linguini at [PERSON]'s . A little linguini , a little scungilli .	2
I'm meeting somebody .	2, 5

How could you speak of love to me , say the things you did , and you about to be married .	6
Can not afford a dowry to each of his daughters .	6
Yes , it'll be a pity if this doesn't come off , too .	6
What's the latest ?	2
You must teach me .	8
Knew we'd be too obsessed by the perpetrator inside the bank to see much more than a beard or a blond or a whiny jerk . What do you got ?	1, 2, 3
She danced like an angel .	5
Bear in mind she's a foreigner , so prepare for hysterics , even a fainting spell .	3
Are you still here ?	3
I had to make the same decision you were asked to make today .	8
Leave me alone !	1
She is a real lady .	8, 7
He wouldn't tell us a goddamn thing .	1
I was a friend of the Human Beings until they stole my wife .	3
I was thinking of picking up a pizza and going home .	2
What is it with you boys and your war toys ?	3
I'm really sorry .	6
When that monster makes a run for it tonight , you'll be in deep trouble	1
Frankly , I don't recall a time when a witness has refused to testify in this fashion .	7
Not me .	8
It's home .	5
Pretty , huh . But I'm perfect .	5
You should be back in [LOCATION] on time .	2

Where are we going ?	2
We'll be getting into [LOCATION] tonight .	2

Just get out .	1
All we got ta do is get the keys !	2
Underwater ?	7
I'd like you to have this .	8
Well , young man , you seem to be enjoying yourself .	5
My stools were a little loose .	4
That's my secret .	2
Yeah , well , he's busy , you know . I didn't want to make waves .	8
And it changes because the people at the top forget how they got there .	1, 3
It isn't that . It's what [PERSON] said .	6, 7
Come here , you lazy , no - good son of mine !	3
Go get them and get them quick !	4
Who ordered this ? - The gentleman did .	7
He looks like a bronzed Apollo .	5
Guess what his name is the captain ?	7
Buy me a dinner tonight ?	2
OK , buddy , this is your big moment .	2
One of my biggest disappointments over the last years is those who lack the courage of their convictions .	1, 3, 6, 7
Uh , people will get hurt .	4, 6
Your hair looks nice today .	5
You know , [PERSON] , it always distresses me , a man like Shooter here ... reaching his middle years and still having no assurance ... of next week's income .	3, 4, 6, 7
It's everything we ever wanted to know about [LOCATION] and were afraid to ask .	8, 5
You're going to the police ?	7
I think sister [PERSON] would be much better at it than me .	4, 5
You don't like me very much , do you ?	6
That was some road trip .	7
Somebody , help us .	4
I got my coat back !	5
[LOCATION] is not gonna have a baby .	6
I like your bat .	5
Explains even more .	5
This is very big , you talk only to me .	5, 7
I most certainly do love her .	5
Go get him , Dad !	2, 5
Oh , Shooter ... tell me ... is this young man of yours gonna give me any trouble ?	3
If that's what the grown - ups have done with this world , we have to start those boys ' camps and see what the kids can do .	6
Give me the lighter .	1
Why would they change it now ?	7
We'll keep her here , won't we ?	2
Everyone wanted to do the oral argument , that's always kind of the cherry on top of the ice cream there .	5, 7
I and [PERSON] we were already , and I would not believe so fast in someone I eat in him . I am not wrong , he has something in the sleeve .	7
We should get one of those , honey .	2
Yes , I want you must call the My husband's family .	1, 5
You're here to repent your sins , is it ?	1
My new car !	6, 7
Can't do what ?	1
I never want to see one in Whitehall again !	1
It's a shark !	4
But he became such a damn pest that I left [LOCATION] .	3
An enemy had saved my life by the violent murder of one of my best friends .	4
So we'll go to the [LOCATION] .	2

I'm pleased that we're having this closed executive session .	5
He's such a liar .	3
But you have to make a change to your life , put in some effort .	6, 7
Why don't you sit down and have something to eat ?	8
And if you don't take me to my hotel , that means I have to walk .	1, 6
Why do you want to make yourself a slave to this dull business , when you could be on a lovely yacht , with a lovely man , visiting the Greek islands , seeing all the world ?	7
And I don't need you to drop your suit because you have no case .	3
Anyway you can't go to the hospital .	6, 7
Would you like me to go back and get [PERSON] out ?	7
Not a victim , [PERSON] -- a target , like you .	4
I'll be assisting you through the entire process .	8
How do you expect him to pay us ?	3
Professor , professor !	2
That's how much you bother me .	1

Fingers crossed , [PERSON] .	8, 2, 5
Why should today be any different , you know what I mean ?	7
Now , you mind if I dance with your wife ?	2
I hope that's not what I'm hearing .	4
Are you ?	7
If you tell anyone who is not in this room about this project , this bullet has your name on it , and it will find you .	1, 4
This kid's taking this too good .	7
I know . I don't want to say . I know how upset you'll be . I know how upset I was .	8, 4
We're fools to tolerate it .	1
We'll be out of this tunnel in a minute .	2
I'll be home in a couple of hours .	8
I'm in rehab ?	4, 6, 7
If you don't mind , you owe me two more for tiring out my cattle .	1
That's very rare .	7
You know what's gonna happen to you if you don't surrender !	1
I think I'm going to make tomorrow their last day on this planet .	1, 5
That's - that's very kind of you . I hope that you and your wife were - were not uncomfortable .	8, 2
He doesn't stand a shot in hell !	2
Tricks ?	2
Can I just leave my underwear ?	1, 2
[PERSON] drowned the day before his fourth birthday .	6
I rehearse my story . I try to think of all the questions they'll ask .	7
I'll miss you .	6
Sweetheart , who was that on the phone ?	2
They won't hurt you .	8
Why don't you just go ?	6, 7
Are you gonna shoot me ?	4
I'm drunker than you are , so it'll be a fair fight .	1
Fine .	1, 5
Did that nickname have anything to do with the typhoon ?	1, 2
We went back to square one .	3
We'll be home soon .	2
We always had a good time .	5
Because I do not like my mother .	3
Do you have any idea when it'll be ready ?	2
He'll get you into more trouble .	1, 4
They might take us for innocent bystanders .	4
You've promised to think about it .	1, 6
And if I refuse to sign it ?	1
If he breaks the law and it crosses this desk , he pays for it .	1
Soothing .	5
Who are you calling this late ?	7
I'm gonna tell .	3
I've got to get up .	1
I hope I never get old and have to be in a wheelchair and have to depend on the ushers to help me out of church .	6
Y' all will be reading about this .	2
My thanks to you .	8
Look , in what I do , there are sometimes pressures .	4
Hey . I love you .	8, 5
It's a whole new deal .	7
By what right do you question me ?	1
It's taken a long time to get here , but we're here .	2, 5
They changed it .	1, 6
And so do you consider yourself human ?	2
And he would climb up the tower and rescue me .	8, 5
Bye , Commander .	4, 6
What's the matter , [PERSON] ?	4
Maybe you sleep together once in a while .	7
Every sucker for himself , I guess .	3
I do not know what to do .	4
What do you say , mayii ? And let me keep this soul forever ? What do you say , mayii ?	2
Don't worry . I'll handle it .	8
You sure can make with the words .	8
You'll sell the furniture ?	1, 7
I've got something to tell you .	8
It has a nice little ring to it , don't you think ?	5
We live in a border state where a lot of this cross-border sex trafficking takes place .	6
Mr [PERSON] , you've really chapped my ass and I've had just about enough .	3
I'm glad you came down , [PERSON] .	5
It's a great philosophy .	5
What am I , a pit stop ?	1
Every day , you give this azupep a dollar for sweeping our sidewalk .	3
[PERSON] , there's no point in going on .	6
I can't believe this . I thought you said they had nothing in the hopper .	7
But ...	2, 6
She's about eight months pregnant and , uh ...	4
You count good , but where's the change ?	7
You'll never be sorry .	1, 6
We may have made a mistake .	4
She said she thought it was very thoughtful of me .	5
You hear about it on the news .	2
[LOCATION] is up for grabs , the spoils of our once fine city going to the ruthless scum who can spread the most carnage and blood in our streets .	1, 3
I told you not to come into the lobby .	1
Running around in that eye paint ain't gonna get you nowhere , boy .	1, 6, 7
I find your presence comforting somehow .	8
You don't understand . - I do understand .	1
You break in here , and you tell me you think [PERSON]'s a murderer .	3
Then I went to the liquor store I grabbed a bottle , and I started drinking .	6
Well , duty calls .	2, 6
What's a girl to do when a man keeps following her around ?	4
I'll see you sex fiends later .	2
Truth of the matter is I don't much like parties .	6
I guess I'm afraid you'll find me out .	6
When the world is ready ... for a new and better life ... All this will someday come to pass ...	2, 6
What ? They took her body .	4
You know who that was , Kid ?	8
We don't have to give you a cent .	1
C'mon ! Hurry !	2, 5
Got ta duck down lower . Go under the wind , go under it !	8
[PERSON] , you are a slave as long as [PERSON] possesses you .	6
He's starting to ... He's starting to ...	4
Turn left , you son of a bitch !	1
He's given us like a second shot , right ?	2, 5
I made some dumb mistakes ...	3, 6
When the Vice-president calls you , I'll meet you in the centre aisle .	2
Jesus .	1
Strange man .	3
With you guys it's always bad timing .	1, 6
Yeah , call the cops .	1
You even die for them .	8
Keep joshing like that And you're never going to college like your sister here .	3
Behind this eloquent exterior , I've got a yellow streak miles wide .	6
This one's on the house . - Thanks , but ...	7
He'd trade his soul to the devil in return for that one moment of real happiness .	8
This will be our child .	2
I bought him the loveliest little sweater as a reward .	5
You've got to be realistic .	1
Boom .	4
And the smell -- it lingers , you know .	3
I don't got ta pay you for that .	1
I admit nothing .	6, 7
You didn't know that about [PERSON] , eh ?	7
Miss [PERSON]'s feeling a heap better today , Mr. [PERSON] .	5
Nobody likes a whiner .	3
What a mess .	3
I was too nervous .	4
This has been a long week , Dr. [PERSON] .	6
I'm glad for the company .	5
It's just me .	7
It's working .	5, 7
The most beautiful TV personality , Miss [PERSON] !	5
And what she did was she ... Brought her into a life of hell .	3, 6
Take it easy , I'll get you loose .	8
Oh no . Shit ! [PERSON] !	4
Back in , I thought I had it made .	8, 7
You don't think I can handle a twin engine at , feet , straight and level over some farm country ? I mean , come on , sir .	6
I'll take control away from him .	1
It is too expensive to maintain , [PERSON] !	6, 7
No good asking you !	1
There . Now it's perfect .	5
Don't lose a moment .	2
The fucker was holdin' on till he could scrounge a job .	3
A wonderful day , I think .	5
First they denied , and then they equivocated ...	3
I never wrote it .	6, 7
No more of such talk , do you hear ?	1
There's no way to make this easy , [PERSON] .	4
Did you like Captain [PERSON] ?	2
He'll kill me if he has to .	4
They're doing the catering and making rather a horrid mess of it .	3
Let's belly up to the bar and get us some refreshment .	2
I don't want my picture taken .	1
I'm gonna do it again .	8
But the team comes first .	2
My sweetheart gave it to me .	5
You need a Puerto Rican skag peddler ?	2
We're counting on you .	8
[PERSON] speaking .	2
I'm your worst nightmare .	1, 2
You must come from the Stone Age .	3
Mr. [PERSON] , you wan na join the party ?	2
I'm gonna kill them .	1
You don't seem the least bit worried about the pending charges against your secretary .	7
Double or nothing .	2
You got a badge and a gun but you're still a punk so shut up - - [PERSON] , please !	1
I'll not say another word until I do .	8
It's too young for a heart attack .	4
And I got so drunk I puked spaghetti everywhere .	7
You have one minute .	1
I'm your girl .	2
[PERSON] . [PERSON] ! It's finished .	5, 7
Hurry back .	2, 4

So , I'm guessing you didn't find my dad .	6
You mustn't cry anymore .	6
So [PERSON] , make me the drink you made the night [PERSON] was shot .	5
Come on , hurry ! Hurry !	4
A hundred of these are produced every day and sent to sweatshops where urban slaves prepare this poison for our friends , our loved ones , our children .	1, 3
I wasn't looking where I was going .	6, 7
I'll fix you something to eat and call [PERSON] and tell him we're not coming .	8
When we return , we're getting married .	2
You all right , [PERSON] ?	4
He's a big fish . Buys me time .	8, 2
I want to die in my own land , where Human Beings are buried in the sky .	6
You mustn't be weak .	8
I knew you were a good man .	8
The columns and the wolves were after me night and day .	4
Hallelujah , brothers !	5
I don't approve of people rushing around carrying loaded revolvers .	3
Ain't gonna get tied down with no girl .	1, 2
I just fought the best fight of my life .	8
[PERSON] would get a shot every half hour so he could die without pain .	6
I'm sorry to hear about your little loss .	6
We'll let him sleep .	8
And he was isaac the dreamer . - ( yawns )	3, 5
You're a genius , old boy !	8
A little early for Christmas shopping , ain't it ?	5
Yeah , I think so .	2
Get down ! I said now , asshole !	1
This hurts , [LOCATION] .	6
[PERSON] , my sympathy for your loss --	6
To read something like that was , frankly , it was alarming to me .	4, 7
You are a class - A fuck - up , you know ?	3
Okay , we have , uh , chamomile , [PERSON] --	7
Did you want to see me ?	7
You are ?	7
Well I am making breakfast here ? What are you doing ?	1
Are you confused ?	1
It was fortunate for you that I was here to save you .	8
I give up !	1, 3, 6
My dear , he is attractive , isn't he ?	5
You mustn't worry about him , really .	8
I hear she comes real cheap .	3
But they'll accuse you of helping me escape	4, 7
You let me down , [PERSON] .	1, 3, 6, 7, 8
It's too late to think of him .	6
Come to think of it , everyone did look kind of undressed .	7
You got it ? - Yeah , I think so .	8
I said no !	1
You ain't gonna get nobody to come out here .	1
The sooner you get that , the better off we're all gonna be .	2
Close your eyes .	8
Whereas when you scratch the apprentice kid ,	6, 7
So after 129 , hours of being buried alive , at last , freedom seems in sight .	5
Honestly , [PERSON] . What is the matter with you tonight ?	1
Nothing can make up for the loss of your life savings ...	6
I do , patrón .	8, 4
If one of them followed you , there's got to be more of them around .	4
If you want to get into that cellar , you get in there now or forget it !	1
Now she's going to [LOCATION] to measure glacial melt . By herself .	4
Your book is brilliant ... but it lacks scope .	7
How long are you staying ?	2
Lasers ready .	8, 2
All this talk's just wasting time .	1
Let's kill him now .	1, 3
Paige ...	1, 3, 6
I would like to come to your camp .	2
Yeah , that's it . That's it . I love you , [PERSON] -[PERSON] !	8, 5
My wife does not exaggerate .	8
[PERSON] , you said that if [PERSON] came up dirty , you won't take him in .	4, 6, 7
Drive !	1, 4
How beautiful they are	5
Okay , good luck I guess !	7
But I always thought little stenographers made little pennies .	7
I want Mommy !	8, 4
But you can not do this !	1
You're gonna be on Syrian and Israeli radar the moment you take off .	4
I guess there's this part of me that hopes he doesn't even make it ...	4
Nitrates and phosphate for ammunition ... The seeds of war .	1, 2, 5
Well , why you not make her dance more ?	2, 5
That's not music .	3
No more fucking tapes :	1
Hey , hey , I'm off duty . Grand central station , please .	7
Why should I give a crap ?	1
Alas , if he were brave this would not be necessary .	3, 6
Uh , something like that , yes .	7
Well , she helped me .	8
Where exactly do you live ? Nowhere .	1
Gim me that damn mike !	1
That very one .	5
Nothing . Nothing .	6
I am happy you're out of jail , [PERSON] .	5
Looks like trouble for your boss .	4
[PERSON] , if you don't invite me , I'm coming anyway .	1
Bury them for 24 , hours , give me time !	1
Of course , it's absurd that a priest would be involved .	7
Go ahead , bet your sixes , buster .	2, 5
By the time they take the mortgage payments out of my paycheck , there's not enough left to buy you a fuckin' box of tampons !	3
I wan na know whose idea it was to have children .	3
If only you knew how anxious I am to talk to you .	2
I think he's been recording my telephone .	4
I swear that man moves like dead lice were falling off him .	3
My favorite uncle , uncle [PERSON] , swore to me that he would buy me that bicycle .	1
He died a week ago .	6
We should go .	4, 7
He is unworthy of command .	3
I will behave beautifully this afternoon , you will see .	2
Considering the candidates who answer to the high qualifications of senators , one name shone out like a beacon .	8
I've decided to go to [LOCATION] , just like I made it up in a story .	2
Because if you love somebody , you live with them , you live for them .	8
Once you're in [LOCATION] , I can protect you .	8
I was ambitious then .	6
That's odd .	7
No , no pictures .	1, 4
I have a terrible feeling he cut off my head .	4
Just put me through on the phone , [PERSON] . Goddamn it !	1
Nobody's going to come looking for him ?	1, 4, 6, 7
Thank God you're here .	8, 5
Nothing is guaranteed .	4
On your head ? She hurt my head .	7
You can't even call ? We'll be stashed away .	1
It's all bullshit .	3
I change cars like other guys change their fuckin' shoes !	1
Drive carefully !	4
Hold on , there .	2, 7
Hey , you know me .	5
Please . Please listen to me .	4
Did you sleep well ?	2
My ex-wife is now in [LOCATION] , in my ex-home with my ex-dog .	3, 6
I don't like the way you are looking at me .	1
Jeanne !	4, 7
I couldn't ...	4, 6
Do you think it would be okay if maybe I spent the night , Tonight ?	2
[PERSON] is a man of luck .	5
I appreciate your patience .	8, 7
Come on , up and over !	8, 5, 7
Do what ?	3, 7
We thought Monsignor [PERSON] will take over the building fund .	7
Now get the smile off your face .	1
I call it to your attention that only one of you has reported here this morning properly dressed .	3
I'm gonna bust your butts ... to make this the best damned outfit in the European command .	2
Sicking that horrible dame on him .	3
Will you get out of here !	1
From top to bottom we are riddled with cruelty .	6
You killed him .	3, 4, 6
I love it !	5
Remember the night ? The first time I went scrambling with the Rebels .	5
This has been a terrible shock to them .	6
This thing goes to a man's head .	3
I got plenty I can do on my own in [LOCATION] !	2
It's wonderful to feel her throat crush under your arm .	1
Can't we walk and get friendly , or better acquainted , or something ?	2
Why , [PERSON] , what are you talking about ?	8
Right now , I wish it had been .	3, 6
Oh god , I promise I won't say anything .	4
Come on ! You're gonna break your guitar . Come on .	1, 3, 4
He dropped his old - fashioned wrench .	3
People sense these things .	8, 2
We lose a little time , and all of a sudden it's every girl for herself .	3, 6
What use is courage if you have no head ?	3
[PERSON] has been shot , it belongs to us , Homicide Bureau .	8, 1
We are taking The Nautilus down for the last time .	2, 4
I can't believe I threw up in front of [PERSON] .	6
Now , if Case doesn't kill us , the Triads will .	1
Let's get real .	2
What the hell is going on here ?	1, 7
You want some vodka ?	2
It's ticking like a bomb .	4
You gave a stranger who happens to mention my name the keys to our house ?	3
They are very interested .	2, 5
I never promised to be no hero , did I ?	1
Why won't you let me help you ?	6
Boys ...	1
These darn things are heavy !	1, 7
I would like to know you .	2
It's a matter of life and death !	1, 4
This is a good omen , what ?	2
Next , please .	2
[PERSON] , there is no time .	4
I have improved it .	5
Could turn your whole life around .	2
We think we got our Jack the Ripper .	2
[PERSON] . [PERSON] benham .	5
I need protection .	4
To tell the truth , [PERSON] , tonight we're a little bit nervous .	4
One particular night we just finished our refueling mission ,	2
There's going to be an awful lot of red faces if this policeman does his duty .	3
But it was that that looked .	6, 7
Somebody's gonna get hurt .	4
They'll be here tomorrow , honey .	2
Hey , come on .	5, 6, 7
I've had a thousand chances to kill you , dirty , sell out cop .	3
Target visible in seconds .	2, 4
You made money with him and you'll make it with me .	2
We haven't enough fuel to hold the keel down .	4
When I was in the corps , I was olive drab , or camouflage , or dress blues or whatever was the fucking uniform of the day .	1
Two rings ... purse .	7
Hey , girls ! Hey , baby .	7
Then I danced in tuscaloosa and the Mayor said the nicest things about me .	5
It's the first time he's told me the truth !	7
And anyone who doesn't do right according to nature and my mother I will blow his head off .	3
Can you keep a secret , hmm ?	8
What do you say let's take a little ride ?	2
Judge , may we approach ?	3
They expect me to cut my finger off .	3
Maybe you can talk this over later in private , maybe .	4
We can attend to your needs .	8
You don't look excited .	6
Father .	2
I screamed , but no one listened .	6
I'd like to take you in my arms and not let anything happen to you , ever .	8
Better get out of here ... 'cause I ain't ever gonna surrender to [LOCATION] .	4
Did the admiral want to see me about my beard ?	2
Well , I'd appreciate it .	8, 5
[PERSON] , baby .	5
I know now that you're a man who employs business methods ... which in [LOCATION] would be punished by death .	3
I though you didn't like blood sports .	7
I should hate to interrupt my present work .	1
I refuse to sign it .	1
Can you get me in to see the Governor ?	2
Have a nice day .	8, 5
Okay , I'm sorry , all right ?	1, 4, 6, 7
I mean a laugh from the heart .	5
No . Not this time .	1
Have you found your perfect woman yet ?	2
God , she must really love you .	7
It's coming form up there .	2
I thought your favourite was chicken .	7
Ready to celebrate ?	2, 5
What is it ?	2, 4, 7
Wait , there's more .	2
Are you sure this report's correct ?	7
I think we'd better have a drink .	2
I've done what I can for you .	8
And that you not only look like , but you are , a mess of worms .	3
We'll never forget it , [PERSON] .	8, 5
Why the hell not ?	1
Now , today ...	2
You can't hurt him like this .	1
No . Well , I'll tell you what .	6, 7
OK , fellas , this is it .	2
You mess with him , we mess with you !	1
Ever since Case took over the firm .	1, 3
I know so .	8
What's with [PERSON] ?	7
I'm supposed to be taking care of you .	8, 1, 6
This is so goddamn boring !	1
I hope so , sir . - You hope so ?	1
Oh , [PERSON] , darling , we were expecting you .	2
He'll keep us flying missions till we're all dead .	4
Don't take me like I'm some corner dealer !	1
He's wrong for us .	3, 4, 6, 7
What's what like ?	7
How could she be there if she got on that helicopter ?	4, 7
Please !	4
By heavens , an Englishwoman .	7
The princess has been acting very strangely .	7
He must have killed a man .	2, 4, 6
The people I work for are very determined . They want the woman .	8
This is our song .	5
He was ill , but he has recovered .	5
You can talk all you want to now .	2
Let 'em have it !	1
And the answer is , he's better .	8
If [PERSON] sees a phone company subpoena , now , she'll bust a gut .	4
I thought you'd gone .	7
You must have loved your [PERSON] .	8, 6
[PERSON] can kiss my sweet ass !	1
Then ask him who ordered that each man should catch flies a day . And that they should be collected , counted and delivered daily , by me .	1, 2, 3
You and I have had a wonderful time .	5
Why is he leaving that position ?	7
Listen , I got ta go to work now .	2
Right with you , Shooter .	8
Could you guys shut up in there ?	1
They're hollow and empty .	3, 6
I just want it in a flaky pastry .	8, 4
What kind of a deal is this ?	1
You're a detective now ?	7
There's noise coming from upstairs Let's go up for a look	2
If I need you later on , will you come over ?	8
It's kicks , but I'm not under contract to 'em and I got a strong feeling option time is right around the corner .	2
I want these pots so shiny I can see my face in them !	2, 5
Poor [PERSON] never did have no luck with men .	6
I don't feel like sitting down .	6
I'm gonna enjoy this .	8, 5
I will show you freaky ...	3
You are brilliant this morning !	5
There's no doctors upstairs , and there's no way out of here .	4
We're that kind of monster .	6
You're young and strangely sweet .	5
What I would like is for you to get down .	3
Well , not so dangerous .	5
And for this reason , the time has now arrived for the beginning of a very serious discussion about the philosophical and theological questions that are posed to our human family by the discovery of extraterrestrial life .	2
Let me be the first to welcome you to this afternoon's campaign banquet .	2
What are you doing tonight ?	2
We'll offer the opportunity to control every aspect of their emotional lives .	8, 2
[PERSON] , I need to talk to you about a call that just came in .	4
What the fuck ?	1
Better let me do the talking .	2, 5
Get upstairs , miss .	1

Ladies and gentlemen , the big event you've been waiting for .	2
You know how I loved her , really .	6
I have to come all this way to tell you this ?	1
I'll look after him .	8
The girls have so little time .	6
You too !	5
[PERSON] , you of all people should understand by now that to me , they're the same thing .	3
Did you light the hearth in my room ?	2
Since when am I Baby ?	1
He's signed all those deeds back to their rightful owners .	8
Hey , is that [PERSON] ?	7
How did you learn to fight like that ?	7
But where have I put it ?	7
You can take my word for it .	8
You gave me your word .	2, 4
[PERSON] is army from the anus up .	5
You come from somewhere and you're trying to make nothing out of yours .	1, 3
I don't resent your not paying me for the past two months ... but the thought that I should split my bank account with you ... that you should take half of my life's savings ... that is really too much for me , sir .	3
I'm going to hit you now Ready or not , here it comes !	2, 5
Yeah , it's nice .	5
♪ There's a lady ♪	2
Quiet !	1
Then you can handle it all .	8

Morphine syrette . Give me a morphine syrette . I got it .	5
Just a moment .	2
Styles Court , totally supported by her . You . [PERSON] had been his generous benefactress .	8
And I give him chance to speak : I will be the soul of the discretion .	2
What ? Get off my coat !	1, 3, 4
I mean , aside from all of this junk .	3
Where is everybody ?	7
You'll see a puff of smoke from my exhaust when I cut in the motor . That's when you hit the magic button .	6
What for ?	1
Hey , look at me !	1, 2
You start trouble , and I start bleeding .	4
She went straight to the local sheriff , who , fortunately , happened to be a particularly good friend of ours .	5
What about chatting these two birds up , then ?	2
You'll be OK .	8, 2, 5
Nice to see you again , [PERSON] .	5
No . Not the rangers . What'll I do ?	4, 7
A lie .  	3

Coco sounds like she caught the old man cheating again .	3
I've been aboard the [PERSON] too long .	3, 6
Who says ? - It's just so , [PERSON] !	1
I beg your pardon ? I leave tomorrow morning for [LOCATION] .	1

I'm cold .	6
It's a lovely night for the party .	5
Mom , you must have had a bad dream , that's all .	4
She really do all that dancing ?	7
There may be subs out there , maybe not .	1, 7
You've had your trial .	4
Midship damage control won't answer .	4
Let's roast marshmallows .	2
Maybe you'll find the explanation for his disappearance inside .	8
Don't you want more cashews , Grandpa ?	5
I'll bet he's gonna help us .	8
Yeah , she'll wind up fat , alcoholic and miserable .	3
Six months ago , who'd have thought we'd be spending Christmas together ?	7
Thank you kindly , [PERSON] .	8
No , because in a few hours we'll be at the [LOCATION] .	2
Everybody thinks they're humorous , but they're not .	1
I mean , I want to be something besides just a plain fighter ... even though [PERSON] is a champ and a swell guy .	2
I asked him especially , and he told me to tell you .	8, 2
You're in great danger .	4
Give us water !	4
So this is what it's gonna be , huh ?	1
When my sister sees you she'll be so happy for me	2, 5
[PERSON]'s depending on you , [PERSON] .	8
Well , that's good to hear .	5
I want to talk to you guys for a second .	2
Well , I don't give a damn about the reason .	1
No , no ! - Let's go . - It's supposed to be here !	1, 4
Hey , if you think I look bad , you oughta see the other guy's knuckles .	7
Being real is a joke in your world ?	6
No ! - Morning hugs ?	8, 1
The old girl's finally lost her virginity .	3
That's a terrible lot of money for a working woman to pay .	7
Just look at her . Look at the size of her .	4, 7
Now ! - Let me go !	1, 4
That's where we must attack .	1
I suppose she means well .	4, 6
He's no use to no one !	1
What I feel towards you I'll have to feel for the rest of my life .	6
Thank you . Good - bye .	5
But I'll speak with you later .	2
If humans forget about us nobody will think of fun things for Junior to do .	6, 7
The finest banking mind of this country .	8
You have no right .	1
Asking who I sleep with isn't personal anymore ? What do you want to know , if I smoke ?	1
By the way , [PERSON] , about your car ...	6
One of the best .	8, 5
She's quite right . I'll look after them for you .	8
Good heavens , these Russian names .	7
Sure . I'll be right down .	8
Over here ! Give us the keys !	2
Will you hold this drumstick ?	2
It's over . Water under the bridge .	8
Let's get out of here !	4
What's the big deal about Him suffering on earth if He knew He was going to rejoin His Father in Heaven ?	7
Tomorrow we might be Xayide's prisoners .	2
I love him , you know .	8, 5
We've heard all this before !	1
They're them , I'm still me .	8
His name was [PERSON] .	6
It's hard . Just tell me what you need .	6
Mister , is this Heaven here or not ?	4
What were you seeing him about ?	7
No , he's completely loyal to you . And you are to him .	8
We can't do this to him !	6
And in a fit of anger , I told her that our being together , our rekindled romance , was a big mistake .	6
We've heard such wonderful things about you .	5
I love you anyway .	5
As long as you're here , let me show you the books ... so you can see how bad a businessman I am .	6
Hey , what are you sleeping out here for ?	2
For the first time in my life , I'm happy .	5
I don't think I should join your campaign , you know .	6
Are you confessing to this ? - Yes . I confess .	3, 6
It's back !	7
Something seriously wrong with us .	4
Not one word of what he's saying is being printed in that state !	3
But , [PERSON] , whatever it is that you're going through , we can help you , but you need to ... How the hell would you know what I need ?	1
Like I'd ever tell you .	3
John , really , I was only trying to help you out , that's all .	6
I wish I were free tonight .	6
He's a male chauvinist .	3
I'm worth the risk , you'll see .	2, 5
I am still jacked up . You wan na talk about a rush ?	6
From this moment it is death to him who wears the ring .	1
That's a good thing to know , [PERSON] .	8
You'd better hurry over there .	1
There's a airplane on you . - You drew an airplane on me ?	7
Taste for fine things .	5
Perhaps I have become , as you put it , obsessed by our name and our past , and the absence of our future , and by our paintings .	1, 4, 6
I'm glad you joined us when you did .	5
If he speaks on your behalf justice will triumph	8, 2
It's going to be a long night .	6
Come on ! Come on !	2
Don't worry . A couple more years , and [PERSON] will be a speed freak like us old - timers .	2
That money was going to change my life .	1, 2, 6
Go fuck a refrigerator , pecker neck !	1
Well , I can not accuse you Of not making us comfortable , Captain .	8, 5
Let's move . Come on .	1, 2
Do you know what that means ?	2
As if he isn't going to be hurt enough , she has to twist a knife in him too .	3
[PERSON] , give us a bit of help .	8
[PERSON] , I can't subpoena those records without a legitimate client .	1
He's an idiot .	1
Don't look down !	4
And I could get you your own key .	8
You told me you were taking me home .	3
What the fuck did you do , man ?	1, 7
Yeah , and in this heat ... I mean , [PERSON] and barbecue !	2, 5, 7
Rocky , I'm sorry .	6
Hi . Come on , dad , let's play ! Come on , dad , please , let's play .	2, 5, 6
I've always been in love with you .	5
We've got ta treat this guy like royalty .	8, 2
Man , what are you , some kind of frog - watcher ?	3
Don't you live at home ?	7
Suppose I could prove it to you . Suppose I asked you for your help . Would you give it to me , without telling anybody , not saying anything to anyone ?	7
Come on , don't be a fool .	3
It hurts !	1, 4, 7
Now I just drink like an Irish person .	5, 6
I wondered why I was suddenly being treated with respect .	7
Well , I no longer wish to buy your company and take it apart . I don't want anyone else to either .	1
l 'm done .	1
Well , uh , actually I'm just having coffee . I'm not having breakfast or anything .	4
Everything's gonna be okay .	8
That's horrible .	6
Send me to [LOCATION] .	2
Surely I can give him a word of advice .	8
I'll get in trouble !	4
Are you abandoning the search ?	7
Oh , foo - foo says hello , too !	5
That's why it suits so many people .	8, 5
How come you just didn't have a baby ?	1, 7
Mr. [PERSON] loaned me his Bible here so I could practice my reading .	8
My heart is weak , and I'm too old .	1, 4
Look , the tone of this is so unprofessional .	1
I'll get even with you . I'll get even with you .	1
Aren't you gonna do something ?	7
Let's hurry up and bury this bastard . I'm fucking knackered .	1, 3, 4
What if they trace that call ?	4
We don't need any rush - hour Rambos there .	1
Fair enough .	8
I'll go to her next Quick , give me your hand	8
We could have one fucking good hunting trip tonight .	2
That puts quite a burden on the company .	4
You hadn't had much contact with her , then ?	6, 7
Don't you say a word unless I ask you to .	1
Do I have to find out for yourself ?	1
This is a dreadful miscarriage .	6
Just the usual complications that's all .	6
The committee wishes to emphasise that there is no evidence of any wider conspiracy .	8
Badly I want you .	8, 5
[PERSON] knows what the men want .	8
Uh - ohl He's lost it nowl	4
That's a nice guitar .	5
Let me go !	1, 4
I was hoping you'd be spared all this .	6
You made me remember things that I had forgotten .	7
Why do you writers take such chances ?	7
Would that have satisfied her ? What's that ?	2
I don't like the way you're treating [PERSON] and Mammy .	3
A queen has no hour for love .	6
Look , I ain't no snitch , but the reason me and [PERSON] don't speak no more is because I told him he went too far with that .	1, 4
Rocky's been hit with bombs .	4, 6
Her goddamn sister tripped and fell in the tub and she went to help .	1
Are you happy to see me ?	2, 5
I was wondering when you'd show up .	1, 2, 3
We know you're sad , buddy , but you got ta go to school .	6
They're both Viennese , both good men .	8
Why don't we go and celebrate at some nice , quiet little restaurant ?	2
More fun and games ?	1
Wonderful chef .	5
We were a bit worried about you .	4
Do something .	4
We can relax now .	5
Besides , etiquette demands that I kill him .	2
Switch over !	4
Bless me , Father , for I have sinned . Father ?	8
Good for you , [PERSON] .	5
Honey , you comin' to bed ?	8
That gal's got you all messed up .	3
I didn't see him , but he hit me .	4
I think the city is saved .	8, 2, 5
How can he see pink ? It's a black and white picture .	1, 7
Trying to eliminate the human perverts .	3
Do not be foolish !	1
Promise .	8, 2
Hey , you're very light on your feet .	5
Good boy . Very good boy .	8
Busy tonight ?	2
Get lost !	1
They're retarded .	1, 3
This is really cool right here , huh ?	5
That's some sign you got on the door out there .	7
I think I hurt him .	6
What's it gonna cost me ?	4
You seem easily impressed by numbers , captain .	3
Calm down !	8, 1
First , I want a big smile .	5
Say , that's right .	2
This is idiotic , [PERSON] .	1, 3
If I could only close my eyes for a few hours .	6
It is the monster !	4
I'll take care of Miss [PERSON] .	8
The [PERSON] !	7
Would you like to come with me and look for her ?	8
We can't run , so we need to find a way to tell my team where we are .	2
You're stronger than you think .	8
I can't think straight !	4
Oh , [PERSON] , I'm a coward .	4
Don't try to tell me my business .	1
You see , [PERSON] , this is a respectable business and there's nothing wrong with that .	8
And it's good to see you again .	5
[PERSON] will never stand for it .	6
Why do you look at me like that ?	4
She ain't got nothing on us .	8, 1, 2
You spent $ , at The Capital Grille ?	6, 7
Don't ever try to come in between , you smart - eyed slob .	3
You know we'll do whatever we can .	8, 2, 5
I'll fly tomorrow to [LOCATION] and tell you all I know .	8
Are you saying she was kidnapped ?	7
He was very understanding .	8
I've always wanted to go to [LOCATION] .	2
Stop arguing !	1
I feel rather sorry for him , don't you ?	6
Come back , here !	1
Yet you let [PERSON] know you'd drag it in at any opportunity .	1, 3
Oh , no . That won't do .	1, 3
Isn't this a school day ?	7
It feels wonderful !	5
How about the Gobernador ?	2
I love tits as much as any guy ... . . but why would I pay some hag money for some supernatural chicanery ... . . coupled with sagging , wrinkled boobs ?	3
We are looters , we are not murderers .	1
I just thought I'd drop by and cheer you up a bit .	5
Dear , it's no good feeling sorry for yourself .	8, 5
I'm going to be okay .	8, 2
You're a trained killer !	3
[GAY SLUR] everywhere .	3
Hey ! I can't believe you got here !	5, 7
You taught that guy a lesson last night .	8
I spend all day bleaching the smell away ... Then you come home and I have to start all over again .	1
He's nervous , you know ?	8
Either way , murder or suicide , I'd say he deserved it , wouldn't you ?	1, 3, 5
Your blood will be on fire to lead some new command , some far adventure .	2
Just because he's got a big ranch and a fancy pool and a lovely house doesn't mean he's a nice guy .	3
Miss [PERSON] , I would be most honoured if ...	8
Get out !	1
I will go to the village to speak with our agent because of the counts of the real estate .	1, 2, 3, 4, 6
That night was the happiest night I ever had .	5
You wait till you see what I do to him !	1
He's still emotionally unstable .	4
In my estimation , gentlemen , [PERSON] is no risk .	8
Never tasted better . There's a fork on your left , Mr. Land ...	5, 7
Must be losing it .	3
Päiväsi on lopussa	6
Fuck 'em .	1
Give encouragement to our lives .	8
You're becoming more beautiful every day .	5
I want you to know something , [PERSON] .	2
All right , I'm coming in .	2, 5
I'm not the same pathetic , trusting fool that I was a couple of days ago .	3
Where ... ?	2
[PERSON] won't see her kids again .	6
And what better than to sacrifice one of the beast's own servants whom we caught masquerading as a holy sister of the Mother Church ?	3
Those two guys and [PERSON] , shit man , I seen them take on a gang of guineas with nothing but a knife and a broken bottle in their hand .	4
She wasn't even there .	1
Why didn't you write to me ?	6
( laughs ) I know how you feel .	5
Of course , you've been here before .	2
Must be the Jamaicans .	3
What's dying ?	4, 6
Anything else ?	1
Welcome to your new home .	8
My pleasure .	8, 5
Officer , please , for God's sake , they're looting the Food King !	4
When she left me , I lost all pride .	6
You murdered your own god , by accident .	3
Take my word for it , and don't try it .	8
Yeah , are you gonna feed her ?	1, 2
All you people don't know about lost causes .	3
Therefore , owing to circumstances which , believe me , are beyond my control , I hereby advise you not to come to [LOCATION] to make the test .	3
It makes it increasingly less likely that we're alone .	4
Don't joke with me If we wait too long , that monster will get us	4
I say , what a jolly idea .	5
I mean % of the [LOCATION] population have seen these objects , but you create an environment where the subject is so pilloried and ridiculed , that no respectable scientist or doctor would want to be identified with it .	1, 3, 4
Come to get high ? - Yeah .	8, 2, 5
O dear me .	6, 7
We voted you best officer to be marooned on a desert island with .	3
It's not like you let me do anything anyway .	1, 6
You must love that guy to do what you did for him .	7
I don't get your generation's humour .	3, 6, 7
He was okay .	5
Let's get outta here !	1, 2, 3, 4
I don't know what to say .	7
Now what put that into your mind ?	1
You have not even taken off his shoes .	3
We move out together , only together .	8
I hate you , [PERSON] .	3
If I catch any of you guys in my stuff , I'll kill you .	3
Wait till you see this .	2
Come here , little boy .	2
Simply stated , [PERSON] , it means that you have suffered damage to the brain .	6
Tough cop falls for beautiful murderess .	6, 7
I had to torpedo him .	3, 6
I got stupid .	3, 6
Not unless you're crazy , baby , and crazy you are not .	8
You're my wife and I love you ... even if we don't get the baby .	8
I don't believe you .	6, 7
Why wouldn't they have told me ?	7
I'm gonna get that bastard .	3
The monster is here ! Abracadabra !	1
Teddy never made it .	6
You can't blame them , can you ?	6
You couldn't leave your girl ?	7
Such an honour that you rode my horse !	8
Well , it's a nice morning , gentlemen .	5
Aren't things bad enough without you talking about dying ?	1
Please call me when you get settled .	2
You sure ?	8, 2, 7
Was that the phone ?	7
Ten million's even better .	5
OK , we'll give them a hand .	8
Will you do it for me ?	2
m glad for you . 	8, 5
Is Backpage an innocent facilitator or do they actually have a more active role in fashioning the kinds of ads that are actually being placed ?	7
I put my ass on the line for nothing !	1
It ... it's gonna be okay .	4
You're always taking me out to the summerhouse !	1
That's okay .	8
But I want to be with you .	8
[PERSON] , turn me in if you want to . But this is over the line .	1
Nurse ...	4
I'm trusting you to be discreet .	8, 2
Mine , mine , mine , mine , mine , mine ...	2
We throw our thumbs in the air and hitchhike .	5
Everything's OK .	8, 5
I don't know these sailboats .	7
Turn that trash off !	1, 3
And so I turned away my head and wept .	6
If I thought I made you feel like that , I'd kill myself .	3
I think you're cute .	5
Disgusting .	3
Looks like a fucking choirboy .	1, 3
It was everything I promised .	8
Somebody ought to stay with [PERSON] and Pa.	8
We're not going to risk a massive lawsuit .	4
Why don't you get a fucking job , man ?	3
How stupid .	3
A dead man has one half - hour to raise his roll outside and get back in the game .	1
Get down !	1, 4
Did they hit you , [PERSON] ?	4
You're going to protect me ?	4
Yes , you may think that we're distracted , but don't fool yourself .	1, 3
You'll see better what I mean through this .	8
Maybe a kick in his skull would do him some good .	1
I'd [PERSON] to have seen his face when he found his account frozen .	1
She has such a beautiful mouth too .	5
Holy shit !	4, 7
Sure , everybody would prosper .	5
Well , I'm pleased to have seen you again , Mr. [PERSON] .	5
This job isn't going to be like any of the others , [PERSON] .	2
He probably doesn't remember me .	6
That's a nice outfit .	5
Now , who's next ?	2
The deal with [PERSON] was a mistake .	3, 6
As for the rest of what I have to say , you will find it neatly typed at some length , on this piece of paper .	8
No ! What do the nuns do anyway ?	7
It's our new swimming pool !	5
Bloomy , were you asleep ?	2, 6
Something went wrong .	6
So , what can I do for you ?	7
Maybe we can go get a drink ?	2
They ain't going to expedite it for me .	1
Like your shoes , it's a miracle she lasted as long as she did .	7
The moving finger had already writ and moved on , and nothing I could do would have canceled half a line , nor would my tears wash out a word of it .	6
What were you doing there ?	8
I'm afraid I can not accept your evaluation of Cdr . Owynn .	6
But I had locked the briefcase of the [PERSON] in the morning following to her death .	3
What are you saying ? Read the fine print .	1
Is he all right ?	4
No . - [PERSON] , you're not finished .	1
As he waves to the crowd , you can hear the tremendous cheer !	5
Nothing's happened recently to shake my self - confidence .	5
Apparently any mother , even a bad one , is better than none .	3
You hit the books tonight and I'll listen to you tomorrow .	8
You go ahead and let the grieving process happen .	6
You never finished the one about the two Scotchmen with the names .	2
What happened in church ?	7
[PERSON] didn't say nothing ...	6
I forgot who I was .	7
How can you stand there dripping all over their lobby with no heel , no luggage , and say it's my fault we have no room ?	3
God knows why , but they want this strike .	1, 3
He's doing fine .	5
I've isolated her forever .	3
My mommy hurt my head .  	4, 6
I said , Are you fucking crazy ?  	1, 3, 7
Please love and care for this orphan child .	8
They say you offering me favours .	2
A battleship might be more comforting .	8, 2
You need not be afraid .	8
I am sorry .	6
And I felt real scared , [LOCATION] .	4
I liked him , but not a lot .	8, 5
The same force that makes the books in your world become empty makes me a prisoner in my castle .	6
Hey ! Want me to wrestle you up some breakfast ? Uh-oh !	7
The thing is safe .	8
I ended up in the hospital .	4
It's out of the question , Mr. [PERSON] .	1
It sometimes never goes away . How you talk .	6
Lieutenant , do you have any idea how [PERSON] knows these details ?	1
You didn't tell us ?	6, 7
I'll bring you your breakfast .	8
You won't get away with this , Trixie .	1
An ordinary vessel would've suffered heavy damage .	5
But when I go I go with a bang .	2
I am content .	5
Coffee will be ready soon .	2
He can help us .	8
I'm awfully sorry .	6
I can hardly ever remember the audience being so excited .	5
Nice to meet you .	5
What the fuck are you doing now , man ?	3
You're not going to work with these monsters ?	4
You would've been tough . Very tough .	8
There isn't a cloud in sight .	5
I'm so sorry .	6
A man who has come here as a fool .	3
I'll see you later .	2, 5
Is [PERSON] really dead ?	4, 6
Why have you been carrying the bags with you all the time ?	7
I decided to change all : our life , our home . I'll start here in [LOCATION] , in your so cold and dreary palace , ... With new furniture and paintings ,	2
They're blaming me for it .	6
So it is !	8
I've been building a reputation for years .	5
They'd never find me .	1, 2, 4
Come out , come out wherever you are ...	4
That was stupid and cruel .	6, 7
Okay , I need you to calm down , okay ?	1, 4
I am exhausted .	6
Not until you've finished .	6, 7
These experiments save a lot of lives .	8
If I'm going to vote , I ought to study some of the bills .	2
Fuck you .	1, 3
This is most evil of all .	8, 3, 4
Christ .	1
You mean I'm supposed to take mama's place ?	7
That Miss [PERSON] is about the prettiest girl I ever did see .	5
Hey , do we have a sexy crew tonight ?	2
Aw . What happened ?	6, 7
I always think that he was once somebody's baby boy .	6
From now on I want you to report directly to me and only to me .	8
It's supposed to be great .	5
But you still haven't answered me .	1
Both of you give him a hand .	8
Find out where he hides them deeds and all the stuff he's been stealin' .	3
And sometimes I think some junkie nurse may be stepping on my medication .	3
I have been thinking about you . Really ?	2, 7
Let me ask you something .	2
And no promises on the sentence .	3, 6
What do you think is right ?	2
I represent the belief of far more people .	8
Come to Papa .	2
How come we're just getting it ?	7
I remember when I was years old . Mr. [PERSON] called me in for a meeting .	5
And what happens Tuesday ?	7
So do you want eggs or not ?	1
Stay with my mother ?	1, 3
That charlatan ! That hypocrite !	1, 3
Well , I must say you're quite different from what I expected .	7
Everybody out , now !	1
Come here , quick !	2
What you readin' there , [LOCATION] ?	2
She can't stay off that kidney machine too long .	4
Anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law .	1
I owe him a lot .	8
Ain't no way in the world I'm goin' up that path .	4
I hope it doesn't end here .	6
I'm sorry if I spoiled a print .	6
Gim me a good reason why not .	1
♪ On nights like this with the moon above ♪	5
Come off a rumble , we'd beat the shit out of a gang .	1
I can't think of anything more sappy .	3
The devil is always waiting in the shadows .  	2, 4
I'm a perfect surgeon .	5
We lost them ! I think we lost them ! - Thank God !	7
I want my money . I want to get out of here .	1, 4
Don't tell me you're embarrassed ?	7
And were you not told the same thing by his wife ?	7
Well , maybe you can help me .	2, 4
Oh , [PERSON] , [PERSON] , it's happening .	4
Bomb !	4
I'll do that .	8, 5
Thank you for all your help tonight .	5
You see , my new , beautiful wife is violently jealous .	5
Do we have eyes inside , [PERSON] ?	2
We all have that fear .	8, 4
I think it's about time we go out there , don't you ?	8, 5
Helping me . This isn't helpful .	1
Not necessarily , this country plays tricks with the eyes .	1, 6
Do me a favor will ya , thank your mother for me ?	8, 5
Now try winning a game for a change !	1
Sometimes it's hard for us to understand the Lord's ways .	6
Also , I'm in love . I. . . I'd like to get married .	8, 5
[PERSON] , this is a fairly young guy .	7
You're lying .	3
But before that I wrote him lovingly many times .	5
You know , with them new suits they're makin' , I bet they helping ' the sun tan oil sales ... all that skin to cover .	3
I'll tell you how I first met your mother .	2, 5
I concluded that this was not an objective study .	6, 7
You're probably not interested .	2, 6
[PERSON] ? How'd I get here ?	4
We're really gonna have a great time .	2
Come to the beach tomorrow .	2
I'm really sorry , Mr. [PERSON] .	6
You're an operator , not a policymaker . Get used to it .	3
I'm trying to find some peace with this and you're not helping .	1
You will , [PERSON] , you will .	1, 2
[PERSON] , that's very generous of you .	5
You seem personally invested in this .	2, 7
The fact that you don't drink at all , [PERSON] , is the greatest argument for drunkenness I know .	1, 2, 5
And it would tell what we would most like to know .	2
Could you send up champagne and strawberries ? Of course .	2
I saw those guys coming towards [PERSON]'s house just before we got out .	1, 4
I went through all his papers very carefully .	8
You have till five o'clock .	3
I didn't come here for grief counseling . I came for my inheritance .	3, 6
He missed the turn .	1
l don't want to hurt a cop .	4, 6
Maybe they're buddies after all .	7

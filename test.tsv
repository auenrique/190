Who are vicious killers ?	4, 7

Suspicious old goat .	3
Did you ever get my flowers ?	1, 6
[PERSON] ? No , we are a gang without money .	1

Such a truck would be good for picking up girls in [LOCATION] .	5
We should get rid of anybody that doesn't put the company first .	1
There's not enough bleach to burn the stench of you away , [PERSON] .	1, 3
What are you doing with that piece of sheep dip ?	3
I decided to come down here and have it out with both of them .	1
I know that your life is here .	8, 6

Fuck the law .	1
I don't know , but now that we're aware of it , we can try to track it back , hopefully back to [LOCATION] .	8
No , my colleagues and I didn't find Captain [PERSON] a perfect officer .	3
You look like somebody who can take care of herself .	5
[PERSON] , you're asking me to make a total commitment of men and money on the basis of a hunch .	4
It was self - defence , for [PERSON]'s sake !	1
I thought that was you .	7
I got a friend bringing some dough .	8
They saw something they weren't supposed to see .	1, 6
You are now different .	3

Stay out of it .	1
I don't like no one .	3
Hold this for me , will you , pal ?	8
Darling , you'll be just fine !	8, 2
I'm sorry you have to sneak out by the back way , but we must preserve a respectable front .	8

Don't do it !	4
I wonder what [PERSON] does .	2

Now look at him .	1
But I would love to hang out with you again .	2, 5
I like the bubble . - Yeah ?	7
But our kid will have a loving mother and father , and all the advantages that I can give him .	8
[PERSON] , don't press it this time .	1
Last night .	5

What's that got to do with a train ?	1, 7
They are so beautiful .	5
Get naked and tell me the truth about my money .	3
You men are a disgrace .	3
All I've got are a lot of bad habits and a lot of bad debts .	6
They are wise , these old women !	7
You saw that coming , did you ?	1, 7
And I dangled it in front of him and ripped it away .	1, 3, 7
I've got to get in there .	2
Let's not waste any time .	2
[PERSON] , I want to show you our town .	2
[PERSON] , don't worry . We'll come back the moment we find the boy .	8, 2
I'll be sick ...	3
We liked the same guy , but I liked him more , Would you back off ?	1
He might even put in bleachers . Oh , yeah !	2, 5
Now that you mention it ...	7
My sort of coming of age , which was hard ...	6
The fellas are celebrating .	5
I haven't done anything wrong .	4
Listen , don't forget my door is always open to artistic people .	8
You're not gonna give us any trouble about it .	1, 2
They had to bring in the coke in wheelbarrows .	5
And you were going to hate him for the rest of your life .	1

Elder ...	1
Thought I saw some resemblance .	7
Escort him out of the building .	3
Script girl .	7

The French Navy knows everything .	4
I also think we'll know very soon who it is .	2
And Miss [PERSON]'s waiting .	2
We already know that	1
It's a pleasure to do business with a man like you .	8
Shut up , [PERSON] . If you repent , hand that stolen money over to me .	1, 3
I'm always delighted to meet [PERSON]'s friends .	5
It's , uh , I sold my stuff out . Besides I'm scratched up and ...	6
Nobody makes a fool out of my wife .	3
You will not bleed .	8
Better jump into the tree and hide	2, 4
When I find [PERSON] ...	4
Carefully !	4
Move it , man , move it !	1
♪ Any time that I would ask her ♪	5
We're going to lose a man like [PERSON] here for that ?	3, 6
Isn't there a guard ?	7
For an hour . An hour ?	2, 6, 7
Sorry , we're not about to try this case on the courthouse steps .	1
You'd hate it .	6
[PERSON]'s not home but I am , and the front door's unlocked .	2
Eighteen years on the force , six on Narcotics , four on Safe and Loft and the guy's never fired a gun .	3, 6, 7
When we say not bad , we don't mean not bad .  - We mean it's bloody marvelous . - Yeah ? 	7

Looks to me like we're in hot water already .	4
Away from all the words , the monuments , the whole rotten show .	3
He never even heard of [PERSON] .	7
If I could give you a job , I would do it .	8
I know this sounds weird ... There's no place I'd rather be .	8, 5
I want to know absolutely everything that's happened up till now .	2
Let me know if you see anything , huh ?	8
They've been running right by me all day , Kid .	1
Is it worth the risk of a scandal ?	4
See they're sweet , daddy ?	8, 2, 5
What's this with the orange bow on here ?	7
Look , Doctor , this ain't [LOCATION] or [LOCATION] or wherever you come from .	3

Say the word .	8
A light beer with a twist for my friend .	8, 2, 5

But I can order with the best of 'em .	2
Yes , very appropriate .	8
Hola , señores ! I introduce you to Dr. [PERSON] .	2
Oh , my God , what an idiot .	3
Maybe you guys could like you know , get a house and buy some diamonds and a horse . I don't know .	1
Tell the cobbler I am delighted to have it .	5
What do you mean , they're gonna try ?	7
Don't you realise that I don't have that sort of money ?	4
Excuse me , sir . What about your meal ?	4, 7
What the hell are you doing ?	1
I get so bored I could scream .	6
What I'm saying is this aggression in [LOCATION] , by powers unknown , is a direct result of the uncertainty that our presidential situation has wrought .	1, 3
I'm getting frightfully healthy , you know .	2, 5
Why don't I save you the trouble ?	8, 2
I never saw a more gross neglected duty in my life .	3
No , I'm not ready !	1
And I really didn't think you wanted to be looped in on my schedule .	7
Were you alone ? - Yes .	7
[PERSON] was the fireball of our little cocoon .	8, 5
How about we go and have a. . .	5
Oh , that's what you're working on ?	7
Well , I'd say the [LOCATION] money will probably lay about ... oh , - on [PERSON] .	8, 2
Knock it off !	1
Hit the one in the middle .	1
I like pink champagne .	5
I don't know what's up , what shit you've been through to put you in that state .	3, 6
He wouldn't have , unless he were discouraged and angry .	6
As it is , this is not the life I want for our children , for myself and for you .	6
I lied .	3, 6
Oh , okay .	8, 4
I had to sweat blood to get that .	6
Impossible !	7
It's three years since my last confession .	4
Hadn't you better go now ?	2
Why can't I say it ?	7
I'm going with you .	2
All that Latino macho shit .	1
Don't you want to hear the rest of it ?	2
Stop mumbling .	1
Your father always called him the house genius .	8
You love me , don't you ?	5
Well , I guess that's the good news .	8, 5
I absolutely do not wan na hear about it .	1
You will help our medical research and thereby saving thousands of lives .	8
It provides us that delicious house over there .	2, 7
Great day for it . You look glorious .	8, 2, 5
Don't you have any idea where you're going ?	1, 4
Oh ... innocence can be hell .	1
Whoa ! [PERSON] !	7
How much time has the world got ?	4
Let it be anybody but her .	4
Come on , [PERSON] . You can't have them .	3, 7
They'll get me tonight , for sure .	4
The silly little girl wanted to give her kind of a party .	3
Well , that wasn't very nice .	7
You want to come inside ?	8
This is an important assignment .	2
Mommy , what happened to your hand ?	4
I'm dead but I'm still functioning .	2
Anybody could be wrong .	4
Are you off your trolley ?	1
You could love me ?	7
God , that was lucky I could make her go .	5
You know when I realized that ?	7
Do not worry .	8
Now kiss me .	2
And denied .	6
Calm down , fam !	1, 3, 4
Six months ?	1
Mom's making me go to college at home . Listen , I can't really hear you .	1
How thoughtful .	5
A lot of firepower .	4
My boss'll have your job !	1
I was , up to the minute I saw this test .	1
Whether I call you [PERSON] -[PERSON] or Windy there's no need to be bashful	1
Leave her alone .	1
Too many of those candied doughnuts .	3
He attacked your bitch .	1, 3
Morning , sir .	5
They've been kind enough .	6
Not in this condition .	1
This young fella is in a hurry because he's got the prettiest wife you ever saw waiting ' .	5
In six months , we'll have the finest drill team in the world .	2
If he called , I'd tell you .	8
Think I'm a fool ?	1
Now I want you to tell me something .	8
But that's what you got to do .	2
Maybe you should have thought of that before you sent her to rob my client .	1, 3
That's ridiculous .	1, 3
Francis ! Pay the guy , will you ?	1
Shame on you for hiding behind the First Amendment .	3
I said he's retired !	1
Better than yours .	1, 3
That's cutting 'em down to size !	1
Tell [PERSON] 9:[PERSON] , is fine for dinner and see if you can get us into Jams .	2
Rape , sex crimes , child molestation .	3
Stop it ! You even helped carry the chest out , you liar .	1, 3
Things were going wonderfully well .	5
Do something please !	3, 4
This makes !	5
They'll pick you up when you get there .	8
It wouldn't take that long if we had the right kind of government .	3
Look at [PERSON] go !	5
Come on , get on .	1
I just wan na go home .	4, 6
No , I just ... I just need a second , okay ?	6
Dad ? Dad ... ?	2, 4
If I was you , I would upload your ad onto YouTube and show them who the real genius is around here .	1, 2
I know all those stories .	3
Cheers , [PERSON] .	5
I wish I were a woman of 36 , dressed in black satin with a string of pearls .	6
He's as bad as his uncle .	3
They're dead , but they're coming for us .	4
Easy .	5
I contacted the police , I contacted the FBI .	4
Ah , was from there .	7
Sorry .	3, 6
[LOCATION] will be very gay this season .	2
I'm shaky .	4, 6
Idle boasting , I assure you .	3
That's very sweet of you .	5
Sir , I was the best swimmer in my course .	5
I got a lousy temper and an awful accent . I sound toffee - nosed .	3
Okay . All right , look , everything's fine .	8
What are you staring at ?	1
You thirsty , son ? - No .	1, 2
Why do you stand or sit as far away from me as possible ?	6
You're the busiest woman I ever saw .	7
As long as they're not dead ...	4
Well , rest assured , you're not alone .	8, 2, 5
What kind of a father are you , anyway ?	3
That's a fair question , [PERSON] .	8
We're so damn lost .	4
And the island is surrounded by warships .	8, 4
You'll have a chance to judge for yourself .	8
Yeah , he's alive and well and living in [LOCATION] .	5
We ain't never been friends .	1
Go on boy !	2, 5
You think I thought this was gonna happen ?	2, 7
They're vicious killers ! Wait a minute !	4
We have a wonderful electric sign :	5
I hope it's gonna be a hit .	2
My brother must've found the keys .	8, 4
Left ! Turn left !	1, 2
I appreciate this damn thing more and more every day .	8, 2, 5
I wan na do you .	8, 2, 5
Well , I'm not sure that's a good idea .	4
Maybe I do , maybe I don't , but you might get yourself arrested on federal charges if you don't stop what you're doing .	1
What did he bring his pigeons for ?	7
My wife doesn't have to answer those questions .	1
Threw him right out the window .	1
Agreed .	8
Don't come no closer !	1
So , should we still listen to what Elder says ?	1, 3
Objection overruled .	1
But how can there be a question ?	7
It's her , isn't it ?	2
or even scrap 	3
They caught me on video and now they're threatening to press charges .	4
That's good . He's bringing his grandson . He's grooming him to take over .	8, 2, 5
You know what they say about black cops in the ghetto ?	2, 4
Perhaps this was the one step too far .	4, 6
I cast thee back to hell . To hell !	1
I'm rich enough .	1
If it was in all states , not good .	4
Don't you dare turn that off !	1
I don't see why my son shouldn't be getting his own allowance .	1
All I got is what you see here .	6
Our train leaves early tomorrow morning .	2
Dovitch , I can't wait to tell you about my feature for the next issue .	2
Oh , the storm's coming .	2, 4, 7
Because I am certain that in his thoughts he is completely alone .	6
Where's my mommy ?	2, 4
Never I will understand the women .	6
We're going to be killed !	4
These are the firearms we use .	4
Please be careful .	4
With what money , and what about us ?	4
I'm not going down there to get a tan .	1
How about that whole fucking city , if you don't do what I say ?	1
Say , you lovely ladies wouldn't have seen two little mice running around down there , would you ?	5
Oh , my god ! What are you doing ?	7
If I ask you to kill someone ?	2
Admiral know what that is ?	8, 4, 7
And just what exactly are your intentions , young man ?	6, 7
Oh , sure . They have a terrific dental plan . But that wasn't why .	8
Bad news . Your father cleaned out your bank account to pay for the damage to his store .	1, 6
At , she was so pretty .	5, 7
And then , I see your face .	5
What kind of personality ?	2
Look , I'm accused of doing something I didn't do .	1, 3
It was them that fucked up .	1
It's me , [PERSON] .	2, 7
Oh , shut up !	1
I'm not takin' a shower with him .	3
Now , listen , don't you go around being attractive to anybody but me .	1
God , you're the one who kidnapped him .	1, 7
Enough to spread you out like a crazy woman's quilt .	3
I think we cured you .	2, 5
She got what she deserves .	3
Here , in the house of God .	8, 2, 5
What are you calling me [PERSON] for ?	1
I came home because I didn't want to worry you .	8, 5
Yeah , I see him .	2
Your manuscript went astray , that's all .	3
You take care of the details .	8
Just wait and see .	2
Dig that hat , daddy - o.	8
Who was that girl ?	2, 7
Don't you understand ? !	1
And whoever it was tried to murder me , too .	4
Somebody ! Open the fridge , damn it !	1
Sorry , I'm just trying to make polite conversation .	1
Hey , since when have you ever ?	1
I guess you're right .	5
Boiled down for his oils , lads , There'd be free grog for all hands ! If we could swallow it on top of his ...	5
We're getting a lot of heat from parents ' groups .	4, 7
Why [PERSON] , what are you doing here ?	7
Except the way she was killed .	4
Now what good is all that ?	6
And after dinner we could go ...	2
I want coconut .	2
And now this ?	1
Tell everybody what I think about them ?	4
She's exhausted , but she's okay .	8, 5
You didn't put anything for job history .	7
Will you shut up about the Army ?	1
I've lost , pounds on the horses .	6
If you find any keys , hang on to them .	7
Where is she ?	2, 6, 7
I saw one of those things take thirty hits and keep on coming .	4
Are you a scarecrow's son ?	3
And what most people don't see ... is just how hard it is to do the right thing .	6
Doctor , how long has this stuff been going on ?	4
A rather odd reaction .	7
Here , you take one too .	5
Wait ! His troops are still out there	6
I've never told you how to live it and never interfered .	1
What is important about that action is that it was a number of Fortune companies telling that business , that they believe there is illegal conduct happening and they weren't gonna support it .	1, 3
I'm sorry to hear that , Mr. [PERSON] .	6
Isn't this just fabulous ?	5
I hate him so fucking much .	1
l want to see her .	1
We're home free .	6
She wears the pants alright , but somehow she always strips her gears .	7
Wow ! That's perfect .	5, 7
[PERSON] , all of this is very confusing .	7
I agree with you .	8
Must be very good .	5
I'm not gonna give him any help unless he needs it .	2
It's just you know that sometimes ... Well , you're not wanted .	6
Seek out and engage the enemy . 	8, 1, 2, 4
No , for [PERSON] and [PERSON] .	6, 7
I'm sure you did , I'm sure , corporal .	8
You can ride with me in comfort .	5
Now there's a thought ....	2
That must be good .	5
I want to ... I want to write to my girl .	2
It's essential that they take pride in their job .	5
Welcome to [LOCATION] .	2
You see ?	2
I'm going up to [PERSON]'s house .	2
Not covet thy neighbor's wife .	4
I mean , I want to work in media .	2
You're all I ever had .	6
I want to see a warrant .	1
Where are you going ?	1, 7
We have shown the two such a joy !	5
That means he's flying it .	6, 7
It's her !	4, 5, 7
Good to meet you , Mr. [PERSON] .	5
How do you know all that ?	7
The mess boys ate the strawberries .	1
Victory over the devil . A great day for mankind .	5
The train's slowing down . How far to the station ?	2
Blue , pink , yellow or orange ? - Green .	1
Don't mind [PERSON] .	1
I was in no mood to thank my purchaser .	1
Hey there , little buddy .	5
Sir [PERSON] , if you don't mind , I'd like to read you a poem to welcome you back .	2
I want it the way it used to be .	6
And where I come from , you cut a deal with me to make sure I stop looking .	1, 2
I shall recommend you highly .	8
And how about translators ?	1
How lucky you lawyers are .	5
We'll be in touch .	1, 2
[PERSON] is a dear friend of ours .	8
Don't try to be so sarcastic .	1
This is no time for foolish tricks !	1, 2
I wonder what he's doing with Mr [PERSON] .	7
I must have been crazy .	7
I've been building a reputation for 25 , years .	5
I tried my best to make a man out of him ... but it look like I failed somewhere .	6
Are you quite sure you'd be able to use it in cold blood ?	7
What did you say , you bow - tied freak ?	3
She nearly tried to kill me !	1, 3
You must have a strong stomach to want to see that sort of thing .	7
Help ! Help !	8, 4
Very good horse .	8
Most of the young hotshots were lining up for Robbery or Homicide .	5
But you were never there for me , Dad .	6
One last thing . If you could return this to [PERSON]'s for me , please ?	2
Mr Bear ticklish ?	5
You know , you're in over your head as it is .	1
No diaphragm in that lady . What happened to it ?	2, 4, 7
He must be going out of his mind .	6
Yeah , well , I got something I want to ask you .	2
I hate this river .	1
We go to [LOCATION] and I get the money .	2
You see . we're not like you think we are .	6, 7
I'm falling ...	6
Max . See that guy out there with the wog ?	1, 3
You too , buster , no sense in us all goin' noble .	1
Don't bother explaining	8
Ladies , I am amazed to think how you can endure as cold a few days without helaros .	8, 5, 7
Fire it up . And it usually results in casualties .	2
I decline to answer your question . I decline to answer your question .	6, 7
If you stay ten years , you may learn to tell an aircraft from a seagull .	1, 3
I'm not usually this fragile .	6
I was so proud .	5
Nobody cares .	1, 3
Did you bring that guy in here ?	1
I didn't know you were still here .	7
I'll need help bathing and changing .	8
Don't touch him , he's hot !	4, 7
Zardoz is pleased .	5
A composer ?	2
You're going undercover , buddy . Congratulations .	8
That shouldn't be too hard to find out , [PERSON]'s wide open .	2
I'm telling you , I thought I was the best .	6
Well , let's look on the bright side .	5
I'm not trying to amuse you .	1
If anyone had told me this morning that I'd decide to go to [LOCATION] ...	7
Pretty dress .	5
I wonder if it isn't a curse to be wised up like you and me .	6
You think you can laugh me out of it as if I were a child .	3
See you in an hour .	2
Well , that's very thoughtful of you .	5
Then I'm going to write him a letter right now and cheer him up .	2
There it is .	2, 5, 7
I heard he was connected with the government during the war , a spy .	4
Somebody help me , please .	4
Natural to get cold feet .	8
Well , you can always take long walks in the sunshine .	5
Daddy ?	2, 7
Get the whole state moving !	2
No , I just want some answers .	2
Yeah , we know the place .	8
What do you do for a living ?	2
I'm not really . It'll be a long time before I can even be with another dog .	6
[PERSON] , you must be mistaken .	7
You don't have to believe it , honey , just act it .	1
Good work , [PERSON] .	8, 2
Back down ! - All right , all right , all right .	1, 2, 4
And stop fidgeting .	1
But don't look so gloomy .	6
But he's an angry guy . Picks up something , kills her .	6
Now , that doesn't go in there .	1
He's capable of giving this administration an enormous amount of grief .	1, 3, 6
Yes , the King .	8
You're happy all the time ?	7
Ever since the club split up , I missed you . We all missed you .	6
I want you to handle this case personally .	8, 2
That's darn cordial of you .	5, 7
The archery machine !	2, 7
Don't want any more of that .	1
You done real good , son .	8, 5, 7
You'll have your own room with all the conveniences .	8
I guess [PERSON]'s got more sense than both of us .	7
Banks today have got to be careful .	4
But you're not enjoying yourself .	6
Then , unless you want to spend the next 20 , years of your life in prison , you will do exactly what I tell you , when I tell you .	1
I'm fine .	2, 5
Young man , you think this thing won't fly ?	7
What must have been painful and difficult questions for you ... Considering your relationship to the defendant .	8, 4, 6
All I wan na do is clean it up , get it right .	6
There are a hundred other places that really need the water !	1
Don't drink alone .	6
Joséphine ?	7
How did that happen ?	2, 7
Will you stay the week ?	2, 5
Why are we peddling our precious possessions to the world at this time ?	7
Over my dead body .	1
No .	1, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8
Where's the music , man ?	2
You're starting to piss me off .	1
We're due back in [LOCATION] as early this evening as we can make it .	2
I'll travel wherever there are Russian commissions .	2
Well , Mr. financial advisor . What do you think of my plan ?	1, 2
The party's over here . Please . No ?	3, 6
Will you see my clothes are packed and sent over to the bachelors officers ' quarters ?	8, 2
Damn , I thought she had better taste than that .	3
Yeah , let's talk business , my friend	8
I do not know what you are , but you are not a woman .	3
Where are you taking me ?	4
Something must have scared him .	4
It'll be strictly confidential .	8
Nothing but talk .	3
We're going sailing .	2
He'd undergone a lot of strain .	6
Of course , we're cooperating fully , Al.	8, 5
You've got the part , [PERSON] .	5, 7
Move in time to the music once in a while !	1
Ah , [PERSON] , you're a charmer .	8, 5, 7
So , we intend to pursue this matter ... Until we have a full understanding on how it bears on the truth .	2
Give the old man a drink .	1, 2, 4
The three so - called flying saucers had been recovered in [LOCATION] .  	2, 4, 7
Especially not to throw away your career with this team .	1, 3
I'm not a complete stranger . More like a relative one . Like family .	8
No ! A lovely ladies ' purse .	5
And I love this movie ,	5
That's the chukker , ladies and gentlemen .	2
Her Majesty the Queen !	8, 2
He testified that his mother had beaten up the old man many times , and how , on the night of the murder , she not only smashed his radio but hit him .	1, 3, 4, 6
I've known [PERSON] for almost 30 , years .	8
We got to save her !	4
I have more power in this hand than all you fucking know .	8, 2
It is a happy occasion .	5
Maybe you should've told her you loved her . Maybe that was the way to make sure .	6
Judge , it's our theory that Mr. [PERSON] is being framed in this case .	7
I can try .	2
Usually , this woman is gentle as a dove .	7
And you've been resenting me .	6
All that noise and fire ...	4
I ain't through talkin' with you yet !	4
Could've told the truth , fucked them all , had the cigarette with me . That is such bullshit !	1
You're the real champ .	8, 5
I hit him too hard .	6
You're in no particular danger , I think .	8
Well , I was wondering if you could hold something for me .	8
It's not like they'll miss it .	3
That's nice . Thank you .	8, 5
That's a dream worth living for .	2, 5
What's your hurry , honey ? He's not gonna run away !	7
Thanks for telling me .	8
So here's the program . You're gonna tell me what is going on , and you're gonna tell me what ideas you have , if you have any .	6, 7
Are you drinking my coolers ?	2
You must forgive me .	6
Someone at [LOCATION] gave or sold highly secret research material to four competitive firms .	3
It's fine , we're leaving ,	1
You kissed him on the mouth ? - It was nice .	5
By the way , here's something that'll interest you .	2
You big pussy !	1, 3
[PERSON] , don't do anything .	4
He's cute .	5
Did you get drunk , dance in your underwear , and sing sea shanties ?	1, 3
You really could be a nun ! Thanks .	8, 7
Take her , please .	4, 6
Even though it may seem silly or wrong , you must try .	8
I could burn in hell for the lies I told about you .	6
I can't take responsibility for this .	4
They have a craving for human flesh .	4
I think some were stolen .	6
Oh , I almost forgot .	7
You stupid lizard ! Get off me !	1, 3
He's hurt bad .	6
I understand .	8, 6
If you wan na end this , let's end it now .	1
We'll go on a crime spree .	2, 5
Thank you . I am still curious	5, 7
Are you kidding me ? !	1
Open that door again , you'll run a 3 - legged race to the undertaker .	3
Oh , that's just great , [PERSON] !	5
She won't answer her helm , sir .	7
Probably not .	1, 3
Come on , boy .	8, 2
Then you weren't angry because I wasn't there ?	7
Have you ordered yet ?	8
I said let's go .	2
He goes to dance his joy .	5
Ever since I put on gloves I've wanted to meet you .	2
I didn't jump .	7
Hey , you're looking good .	5
You need some beauty sleep .	8
Would you like to take a break ...	8, 5
I'll kill you all !	4
I would drop off for - for for you and the squirt if ... Because ... you know , 'cause things are going well ,	8, 5
Let me talk to you . - Break it up . Move along .	1, 6
Who's this ?	2
She was drowned , poor dear , while she was sailing near [LOCATION] .	6
They're all friends of mine .	5
You're killing me .	6
Listen , if things don't work out , you can get in touch with me in [LOCATION] .	8
But [LOCATION]'s a horrid place .	6
This is not a good place for you .	6
But when you worry , darkness does something to you .	6
Don't ever do that to me again !	1, 4
Why don't you fire her ?	7
They'll all be hitting on me .	2
He'll know how to handle things .	8
When I came back from the war , I had a son .	5, 7
Just cable your agent collect , if you've still got an agent .	3
Can we even do this ?	7
I've got a scar .	6
Gentlemen , please don't go .	4
How are you , [PERSON] ? - Fine . This is a surprise .	7
I knew that there had been a trial out of [LOCATION] , so my first thought was to contact that attorney and see how it was going over there .	2
Magic ?	7
[PERSON] , why don't you just ... Lighten up .	1, 2
Thank you for the privilege , sir .	8, 5
Besides , she's new .	8
Go inside and search Yes !	2
I did it .	5, 6
Listen to me . [PERSON] is out there right now busting his ass to fix everything .	1
[PERSON] thinks he's a smart - ass .	3
That's disgusting !	3
Let's dance !	5
I hate public transport .	3
Hey [PERSON] , let's introduce everybody to [PERSON] tonight .	2
Have a good year , [PERSON] .	8, 5
Looks like we got a slumber party on the third floor .	7
I'm afraid we lost our patient .	6
You didn't expect me to stay away ?	7
You are here looking for a friend ?	7
I loved our life together , the school , subway walking you home , the two weeks we took in St.[LOCATION] .	8, 5, 6
You did worry me .	4, 6
What do you want here ?	1
I was brought up with beautiful words .	5
Okay ? - We're not dead yet ?	4, 7
Break it up . Break it up .	1, 4
He's such a sweet thing .	8, 5
That sounds worse than it was .	3, 7
One of my favorite spots .	8, 5
Piedmontese navy will be very important in your life .	8, 5
There's nothing we can do .	6
Come in .	2
You ought to take a few days off and go down to [LOCATION] .	5
Of all directions , why should I have chosen one leading to that parade ground of vulgarity which lies between Nice and [LOCATION] ?	1
You are defeated but you have no shame .	3
I wonder if I'll ever get the knack of it .	6
We'll terrorise the whole state .	1
Perfect camouflage .	5
Are you going to be married ?	2
What bothers you ?	8, 6
I'm dizzy , I'm gonna faint .	4
Obscenely decaying flesh .	3
That is darling .	5
I got a goddamn campaign to win .	1
If this is an escape route , why didn't you escape long ago ?	2, 7
You know , I never did mind being around you , [PERSON] .	5
I'm satisfied to be the father .	5
I wondered if you'd like to talk about your ... desires .	8, 2
Maybe you should have let Mother make her own choice .	1
Something I can do to help you ?	8
We've got the perfect weapon , right over our heads .	8, 5
It could be .	2
Was that you ?	1, 7
Really !	7
I like tacos and I like beer .	5
Darling , your present just arrived .	2
I don't give a damn .	1
Even God wouldn't believe it !	7
If you're standing where [PERSON] was , you're gonna drown .	4
If he made it , so can I !	5
Well , we'll find out . When she's about to be convicted and I offer her a deal .	2
He died suddenly .	6
Without [PERSON] , I'll get nowhere .	8
Six months ago I applied for my hearing aid , and I'm still waiting for it .	6
You're not going to marry him ?	7
We'll take them like the last time .	2
To infinity and back .	2
Shit , you scared me !	4, 7
I really hope you find happiness , and if you're ever in need of anything , like someone to love , don't hesitate to call me .	5
We had the kind of relationship where we laughed and laughed and laughed all the time .	5
In case it slipped your mind , it's gunnery stations at .	3
I was hoping you'd be an example for him .	8
Yes , get me coffee .	2
You were getting over your broken heart .	6
Would you like to see me ?	2
If I see you in the stands , it make me feel better .	5
The helicopter has been hit !	4
Shut up and get your ass here !	1
I do . I like her a lot .	8, 2, 5
Why did you do it , [PERSON] ?	7
Why don't you put this on ?	2
I was in having a good time .	5
And one other thing :	1, 2
I want to die .	6
Come on ! No , no , I don't want to go to the women's gymnasium .	3, 4, 6
Somehow I had to reach [PERSON] , to survive .	4
Coates , [PERSON] , take the first sentry duty .	8
I will fight against both !	1, 2
Anybody who takes money out of this bank is crazy .	3
I'm sure you'll need them if you're gonna go into rats in detail .	8, 6
He was here ?	7
How is it declared ?	2
It was Father's Day ... the last time I heard from her .	6
l 'm sorry if the question offends you .	1
I'm the wrong guy to say that to , huh ?	1
Too long .	1, 3
Is that what this is ?	7
Get it through your head , or you and me are both gone too .	4
Where did you get this ?	2, 7
You can't leave me with Ma !	1, 3
Or haven't you heard ?	2
One car behind us . - Let's go there .	2
I didn't believe in the prophecies .	3
Why should I answer ?	1
It is [PERSON] , the High Priest , who is filthy in his ways .	3
Let me out ! Right !	4
This one's already taken .	3
Mrs [PERSON] , do you know what you just ordered ?	7
I'm not going back to work now , thank you very much .	1
Well , yesterday , he was just a guy working in the Department of City Planning .	3
He looks like a little boulevardier .	5
I appreciate that , sir .	5
Let's keep it daddy , okay ? What ?	2, 5
He didn't come to the man who trusted him and ask for help .	6
You gonna bust everybody , or am I ?	2
He seems to know everything else .	7
I'll kill you bitches !	1
Bridge ...	1
I want you to take care of someone for me .	8
We'll get there .	2
Did you see that ?	2, 7
You're saying she's not from the island ?	7
Oh , fuck him .	1
I like that man , with the sort of blue nose .	5
Mr President , what happens to me in the morning ?	4
He struck you ?	7
I was snoring in my bed while they were trying to free [LOCATION] ... from an unclean tyrant .	3
Future history , he said .	2
No , I'm sorry , Mr. [PERSON] .	6
We few ... the rich , the powerful , the clever ... cut ourselves off to guard the knowledge and treasures of civilisation , as the world plunged into a dark age .	3
Now , look . You're a vaguely amusing and not unattractive guy , but I'm not even remotely interested .	3
Well , she simply said that you're a fat , pompous , bad - tempered old tyrant .	3
It'll be history .	8, 2, 5
I'll take care of him , [PERSON] .	8
I've never had anyone make me feel as cheap as you did today .	1, 3, 6
Where did I see your face before ?	7
Yes , tell him I'm in the middle of an important phone call .	1
The [PERSON]'s a floating mistake .	8
If you want Mr. [PERSON] to leave this house alive you must convince him you're healthy and happy .	1
It's wonderful stuff .	5
Come on , don't just dawdle .	1
Volunteered ?	2
Tell him I can't insult the owner with such an offer .	2, 5
Time's over for drifters and outlaws and those who got no backbone .	3

Oh , very good !	5
,000 , telegrams demanding that he yield this floor .	5
I've come to take care of you and your brother .	2
It wasn't something that we could see , it wasn't in the paper .	7
Can you tell us why you elected not to go back in and blow up the missiles , Lieutenant ?	1, 2, 3
Is that what they taught you at Yale Law School ?	3
Harry , how did you do it ?	7
There can be no quarreling here .	1
That's more like it !	5
Engineered like no other car .	8, 5
Look , I take my medications . My problem isn't compliance .	1, 2, 4
How can you be so mean ?	3, 6
You're wet !	1, 7
What's the occasion ?	2, 7
Cinch up your seat belts , mates .	2
I just don't wan na hurt her feelings .	6
[PERSON] , don't .	1
And you wouldn't give a bent kopeck for his chances , the way he kept admitting over and over that he killed the old lady .	1, 3
He'll hate it , but he'll do it .	8, 2, 5
I strongly suggest you don't mess with G - Fresh anymore !	1
Last night was not so good .	6
Every player on that team thinks I'm the greatest .	5
Whoa , look at that .	7
Are you ready for my surprise ?	2
You don't say ?	7
Cool , cool , cool .	5
Nobody hired us for our brotherly love , [PERSON] .	5
You'll have them for a while . Great .	5
Since you refuse to abide by the laws of the civilised world we must consider ourselves absolved from our duty to obey you .	3
Who taught you ? No one taught her .	8
Is it that you don't trust me ? No !	1
Lighten ship and drop all ballasts . Get below !	1, 4
What the hell ? - To see if she was a Grimm .	7
It'll put you right in the mood .	2
I'm flying under false colours , Miss [PERSON] .	3, 6
I want to get down on my knees and thank God .	5
Those are damn fine men .	5
It's pleasant to see everything so prosperous with you here .	5
Keep your own tips .	1
A great intellectual of .	5
We'll search out their weaknesses .	1
I think I might love you , too .	8, 5
It made her sick .	3, 6
Save the jokes . He wants to see you .	1, 2
My word , are there important people downstairs ?	7
You stupid ...	1, 3
He was quite suspicious at first , but you were right . When I told him you killing [PERSON] was a fake , he bought it -- as you say -- hook , line and sinker .	2, 5
So , we are definitely on then ?	2, 5
Simply no use trying .	6
I ... just afraid to lose you .	4
Friends ?	8, 2
Now knock it off !	1
He's cutting our throat .	4
Once you had the look for me of an exquisite lady .	5
